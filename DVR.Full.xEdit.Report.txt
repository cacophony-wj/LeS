**DIABOLIST VR MODLIST REVIEW CONCERTS**

** FULL xEDIT REPORT **

Firstly I must say I am very impressed with how clean the xEdit is for this list contrasted with the original 
submission. I thought ex0-tekk had disappeared, but it's obvious now that he has merely been working very 
hard on his list.
 
 [35] Skyrim Bridges.esp (C724B281)
 
 You may want to have Bridges win these Landscape conflicts as opposed to Landscape Fixes.
 Landscape Fixes just alters things like grass whereas Bridges probably has changes to the shape of the land.
 If you don't do this, you may have seams or obstructions.
 At the very least, check the cells in question.
 
 [48] Dark_Forests.esp (13FA74E3) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 
 
 Shouldn't Dark Forests win Landscape conflicts over vanilla files?
 
 [5E] eqRLE_CORE.esp (C70F2AC9) \ Armor \ 00016EE4 <SkinTroll>
 
 Many of these values were reverted by a merge.
 Ensure this is correct.
 
 [60] Skyrim Immersive Creatures Special Edition.esp (E92A5A2D) \ Non-Player Character (Actor)
 
 SIC changes some of these creatures to different base templates as part of their uniqueness.
 They have been reverted by your CR.
 Is this correct?
 
 [6B] AVExpansion.esp (E11A2FFB) \ Leveled Item
 
 Hmm, which Synthesis patcher did you use for your Leveled Lists here?
 I use Armor Variants.
 I may use your patcher myself if is well-made.
 
 [6B] AVExpansion.esp (E11A2FFB) \ Outfit
 
 Couple of outfits from SIC were also reverted here.
  
 [CB] ElysiumEstate.esp (CDCBD5E8) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 0000963B <WhiterunExterior15> \ 000A3449
 
 There's a pretty serious Navmesh conflict here, but not critical since no door triangles involved.
 Consider regenerating this navmesh in the CK, 
 Or allowing Ancient Land to win, as it is the most drastically different from vani1lla.

** README NOTES **
 
 Instructions for adjusting Supersampling and in-game resolution should be clearer.
 
 Damn that's a lot of MCMs!

** GAMEPLAY NOTES **

 I experienced one crash during gameplay while testing performance in cities. It was not repeatable. I am not sure if 
 this was a fluke given Skyrim VR's overall bugginess. To minimize future problems, I recommend consulting Timboman's 
 UVRE readme and other VR modlist developers for full steps to ensure as crash-free an experience as possible. These 
 steps should be communicated in your own readme as well, as it is difficult enough to encourage users to read even 
 one of them.
