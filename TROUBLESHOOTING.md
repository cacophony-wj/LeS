## Content

### What gives? I want creatures! Where is Cursed Loot? Where is the roleplay? This is too softcore!

Boy did you ever download the wrong list. This list is mostly for playing Skyrim with titties in it.

Your only option at present is to install the _Dungeons & Deviousness_ modlist to experience the most Lover's Lab content this side of an Oldrim installation. You may feel that _DND_ goes too hard in the direction of suffering and roleplay. If this the case, consider reading about the mods inside it and configuring the menus more to your liking. They are actually very customizable.

## Gameplay

### I don't have one of those ancient NUMPADs! How am I gonna use OStim?

From my user _BigMac_

> If you hold F8 for 10 seconds it activates OSAs emergency rebind. Where Lshift pulls up the menu and WASD is how you nav. You can then rebind the keys manually. I use P L ; '  to nav, O and [ as yes/no and ] as toggle.

### My skills don't seem to be leveling up!

The prompt to level up your skills will appear after you level up. I recommend choosing your new stat, then closing the menu, assigning your points, only to return to the perk menu and make your choices with the upgraded values.

Still not working? The uncapper preset prevents skills from leveling beyond your level +18, to a maximum of twice your level. If your skill won't go up any further, try gaining a level!

Skill not leveling up upon reading a skill book? Check for any debuffs to skill gain on your magic effects tab. Take care of those, then try again.

### WARNING! DON'T LISTEN TO ORLANDO!

Upon entering a certain inn, you will be given the option to stab a certain Vigilant of Stendarr with a Needle. **DO NOT DO THIS.** This is basically a means by which veterans to the "VIGILANT" mod can skip 3/4 of the mod to get to the fun stuff at the end. You will be _extremely_ underpowered and _utterly_ clueless as to what is going on if you do this. **SO DON'T DO IT!!** No, there is no way back. You will have to load from before you did what the obviously evil dude told you to do.

### I can't induct members into the Blades! Or other Follower weirdness!

Sadly the follower framework I use is nowhere near as advanced as _Nether_, and I prefer not to use that one for reasons which are important to me. Search around the Discord if you're curious why. In any case, you can disable _Simple Follower Extension_ and fix issues with your followers by going to Farengar's office and clicking the little plaque to the right of his Enchanting Station.

### My follower is walking around with an exploded head! (Or other types of gore.)

The fix I installed for this doesn't always trigger. Try casting the "Maximum Mending" spell you started the game with. It removes the gore effect from all nearby NPCs.

### The tuning gloves in Winterhold seem to be acting up.

Try removing them and equipping them in between atempts. I dunno either, man.

### The Civil War questline is horribly messed up. I can't complete the Battle(s) of Whiterun / Solitude / Windhelm. People are inverting backwards off the ground. Enemies don't stop spawning. There's no Ulfric/Tullius!

The Civil War questline is incredibly broken even in vanilla Skyrim partially due to the large actor count and infinitely spawning enemies. Pile on CGO scripting all attack patterns and animations and Ultimate Dodge scripting all movement and you have a recipe for disaster. Even if you do manage to complete it, countless other quests will be broken due to destroyed buildings / dead NPCs / flagged variables. It's recommended that you complete this questchain near the very end of your playthrough, if at all. If you choose to do so, I recommend keeping the following things in mind:

1. Infinite enemy spawns are based around the destructible barricades. Hit them three times with a weapon or Destruction spell to destroy them and stop spawns in that area.
3. The above does not always work. If you find enemies never stop spawning, _sprint_ to the capitol building of the city you are attempting to reclaim (Dragonsreach, Castle Dour, etc) and make your way inside.
4. The conclusion of the Battle for Whiterun / Solitude / Windhelm is triggered by entering this capitol building.
5. You do not need to escort Ulfric, Galmar, Tullius, Likke or anyone else all the way to the capitol building. Sometimes they won't even spawn when you enter the city! Merely entering it yourself is enough. Just as followers appear beside you, so will the faction leaders.
6. Enjoy the rest of your horribly broken playthrough.

### I'm trying to kill the Necromancers for Undeath and the quest won't complete.

Yeah, this is just a buggy part of this mod, at least when included in a large modlist like this. After clearing the ritual site, try opening console and typing `killall`. That should clear the quest. If that doesn't work, highlight the dead Necromancers and type `resurrect` followed by `killall.` If this STILL doesn't work, you will probably have to repeat this portion until it does.

### I can't find the attack site that Lan describes in Riverwood.

Another victim of the overmodding problem. You're not crazy, the mod is not malicious, sometimes Skyrim's Story Manager doesn't spawn the site. It would be very easy to find if it had spawned. Just find the Roadside Ruins South of Lake Illanata and wander around until you run into a pack of wolves attacking a Nord woman. Fight them off, and you will be able to continue the Quest.

### I set OStim to Auto Mode and things got weird.

Auto Mode is a work in progress. I recommend leaving it disabled completely, even for "aggressive" scenes. It has a tendency to get locked up in a solo animation, a kissing animation, not progress to later steps in the scene, among other issues. I'm sure it will improve over time.

## Technical

### I crashed!

Slow down there pardner. Skyrim crashes all the time, less so in vanilla but more so with over 700 mods. First make sure it crashes the next time you do the exact same thing. If it does, drop by the support channels on Discord and give as much detail as possible and I'll fix it.

### I'm randomly crashing!

You probably don't have enough paged RAM. Skyrim is very badly optimized. Try increasing your pagefile size. The recommendation is to set it to "System Managed" for all of your hard drives, but you can read specific instructions by going to any Wabbajack Discord channel and typing ``!pagefile`` 

### As soon as I start the game in the main "overworld" everybody starts spinning around and collapsing at the speed of light!

This happens sometimes to some people when the framerate is not capped. Please ensure you copied over the _Game Folder Files_ as the main readme suggests. While you're at it, why don't you skim it again to make certain you didn't miss anything? I know it's long, but it's kind of important.

### I gave something to a follower and it crashed!

Was it less than a full stack of arrows but more than half of that stack of arrows? Yeah, this is a bug and can't be fixed. Don't do that!

If it was something else, first launch the game and try it again. If it happens again report it and tell me which item it was!

### I have problems with the camera! Flickering, weird 1st person body clipping! Can't switch to 3rd person!

These are all caused by the extremely janky customization that makes first person POV sex under OStim a possibility. You are probably better off disabling both "Improved Camera" and the "Improved Camera INI" in the left pane of MO2. They do not have traditional ESPs, so your save will be fine. For a compromise, you can switch _to_ third person with the "F" key, and _back_ to first person with the scroll wheel. yes it is quite jank

### My performance is really terrible, low FPS, input lag during combat!

Your CPU or GPU are probably too weak. Head over to my Discord server and check the pins. 

### I have a bug that's not in this list.

The best way to get it looked at is to submit it to [Issues](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/issues). It's a list, I remember lists, I don't remember or sometimes even notice other things.

If you don't want to do that, I'm not going to be particularly strict about this since people have many reasons to avoid creating yet another account somewhere. So just drop by Discord. If I see it and it's not a known issue I'll try to help.

### I added a mod (or mods) and something weird happened.

Feed free to stop by my private server and talk about it. I'm usually in a good mood and willing to help unless you did something crazy like add seven huge quest mods, all available patches for those mods, and all available LOTD patches for those mods and their patches. Then you're on your own! You can always browse _Lively's Learn To Mod Series_ to get info on how to change any modlist you want. Just if you're going to lose your mind about it and try to pile on 50 SexLab mods try not to bother anyone else about it yeah?

### There's more than 255 ESPs! Will this thing even launch?

Yes. ESPs flagged as ESL don't count. Double click the little number to see how many real ESPs there are.

### My load order got messed up!

I have included backups. Click the swirly arrows. There's one for the load order (right pane) and one for the install order (left pane). Be sure to get the most recent one!

### I crash in Project AHO when I complete a certain quest!

Try this. Load before you start the quest's conclusion. Complete a step. Save. Reload. Complete the next step. Continue until you finish the quest without crashing. I have confirmation that this does work.

### I can't take two steps in Lucien's final dungeon without freezing or crashing!

Lucien's final dungeon has a TON of custom models and assets that are quite demanding even WITHOUT the massive texture overhauls of _Licentia_. I have already installed the only mod created to resolve this issue by adding more occlusion planes to hide non-visible objects. My recommendation to you is to either disable all 4K Texture mods temporarily (except those with ESPs -- look inside the mod folder) and also disable the _SmoothCam_ mod. Hopefully this fixes your problem, otherwise, I'm afraid I don't know what to do as these freezes seem related to weird system configurations. My team members were able to push through the dungeon even with the crashes by carefully staring at the ground and using _Whirlwind Sprint_ in the worst areas, but they are _extremely_ determined!

### My quests have started to disappear from my Quest Log.

Skyrim uses a very tiny variable to keep track of these. The maximum number of quests you can have, both active **AND COMPLETED,** cannot exceed 255. When this happens, the older quests will start to vanish. _There is no way around this limitation, it is hard-coded into the game._ If you somehow find yourself playing the hundreds of hours required to do this many quests, read and follow the directions in this mod when you first notice the problem: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56130  You can also find a Synthesis / Mutagen version of this Quest Recovery tool if you are more advanced.
