## Updates

### An update came out! It's new and shiny! What should I do?

**DO NOT UPDATE if you wish to continue your game.**

First, check CHANGELOG.md. If you are not interested in the changes, or they do not address a bug you are having, **do not update**.

**To confirm: all BodySlide customizations, and additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your saves and downloads folders will not be touched!**

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite_ button.

## Technical

### I have a bug that's not in this list.

The best way to get it looked at is to submit it to [Issues](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/issues). It's a list, I remember lists, I don't remember or sometimes even notice other things.

If you don't want to do that, I'm not going to be particularly strict about this since people have many reasons to avoid creating yet another account somewhere. So just drop by Discord. If I see it and it's not a known issue I'll try to help.

### The "scenes" are misaligned! Tab As are not going into Slot Bs!

SexLab is far from perfect. Use the hotkeys to align the scene. L goes closer, Shift-L farther away. ; goes higher, : goes lower. ' moves to the left, " to the right. Check the hotkeys menu in the _SexLab_ MCM for more commands.

### I enabled a feature and it's not working.

I won't answer questions about features I disabled. I disabled them because I couldn't get them to work. If you did, that's great, explain how and I'll pin it with a note to ping you so you can support people who ask questions about it.

### I added a mod and something weird happened.

See the main README. Long and the short of it is, you're on your own unless I'm in a good mood.

### There's more than 255 ESPs! Will this thing even launch?

Yes. ESPs flagged as ESL don't count. Double click the little number to see how many real ESPs there are. Answer: a shockingly low amount!

### My load order got fucked up!

I have included backups. Click the swirly arrows. There's one for the load order (right pane) and one for the install order (left pane). Be sure to get the most recent one!

### Why do I have to CTRL-CLICK to build _BodySlide_?

_Mod Organizer 2_ does not put edits to existing files in the _overwrite_ folder, only newly created files. _CBBE_, _3BBB_ and _BD_ come with "default" meshes that will be changed by _BodySlide_ if you do not direct them to the proper directory yourself. Likewise, _Nemesis_ edits all the animation source files when it updates instead of putting the changes in the overwrite folder. If you don't believe me, I encourage you to check _MO2_'s documentation or the _Nemesis_ closed _Issues_ section on Github. If this doesn't convince you, I encourage you to test it yourself.

### My body looks boring and flat! or My boobs are melting into the ground!

You either didn't run _BodySlide_ or ran it wrong. Follow all the steps in the [Female Bodies and Outfits](https://github.com/cacophony/LeS/blob/master/BODYSLIDE.md) section again, especially the bits about making sure everything went to the correct directory.

### I read a skill book but my skill didn't go up!

This is because you "can't concentrate" if you're horny, so you don't get 100% skill experience from skill books. Check the _Magic Effects_ tab of your _Magic_ window for **red** effects that affect experience gain. Usually they are marked **Lover's Desire**. Take care of business and _then_ read the book.
