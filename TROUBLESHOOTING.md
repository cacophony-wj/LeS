## Updates

### An update came out! It's new and shiny! What should I do?

**DO NOT UPDATE if you wish to continue your game.**

First, check CHANGELOG.md. If you are not interested in the changes, or they do not address a bug you are having, **do not update**.

If you do update, copy out the entire _profiles_ folder within the _LeS_ directory to somewhere **you will remember.**

**This is your final warning, Wabbajack will delete your saves when updating!**

**To confirm: all saves, BodySlide customizations, and additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!**

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite_ button.

When the update is complete, **move** the _profiles_ folder back into the _Licentia et Servitium_ folder and choose **not** to overwrite. (Your saves will be restored but any modlist changes will be kept.)

Next **delete** the _profiles_ folder leftovers from your backup, as they only have old and useless files.

You should be ready to continue as per the installation instructions in the README (back on your browser)

## Technical

### I have a bug that's not in this list.

Submit it to [Issues](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/issues). You might not know about the issues tab until just now. You might not want to create an account. You will probably want to talk about it on Discord. I might respond to you, I might not. I might tell you to submit it, I might just ignore you. If you're serious about me looking at a bug submit it. I'll at least give you a response.

### I enabled a feature and it's not working.

I won't answer questions about features I disabled. I disabled them because I couldn't get them to work. If you did, that's great, explain how and I'll pin it with a note to ping you so you can support people who ask questions about it.

### I added a mod and something weird happened.

See the main README. Long and the short of it is, you're on your own unless I'm in a good mood.

### There's more than 255 ESPs! Will this thing even launch?

Yes. ESPs flagged as ESL don't count. Double click the little number to see how many real ESPs there are. Answer: a shockingly low amount!

### Why do I have to CTRL-CLICK to build _BodySlide_?

_Mod Organizer 2_ does not put edits to existing files in the _overwrite_ folder, only newly created files. _CBBE_, _3BBB_ and _BD_ come with "default" meshes that will be changed by _BodySlide_ if you do not direct them to the proper directory yourself. Likewise, _Nemesis_ edits all the animation source files when it updates instead of putting the changes in the overwrite folder. If you don't believe me, I encourage you to check _MO2_'s documentation or the _Nemesis_ closed _Issues_ section on Github. If this doesn't convince you, I encourage you to test it yourself.

### I tried to wear a piece of gear but my body disappeared!

If you are male, there are no male models for _Devious_ equipment in this list. They will all be invisible. I encourage you to refer to the MCM section to disable Cursed Loot.

If you are female, the _Devious_ equipment is invisible unless _BodySlide_ is fully run. Follow all the steps in the [Female Bodies and Outfits](https://github.com/cacophony/LeS/blob/master/BODYSLIDE.md) section.

### My body looks boring and flat! or My boobs are melting into the ground!

You either didn't run _BodySlide_ or ran it wrong. Follow all the steps in the [Female Bodies and Outfits](https://github.com/cacophony/LeS/blob/master/BODYSLIDE.md) section again, especially the bits about making sure everything went to the correct directory.

### I read a skill book but my skill didn't go up!

This is because you "can't concentrate" if you're horny, so you don't get 100% skill experience from skill books. Check the _Magic Effects_ tab of your _Magic_ window for **red** effects that affect experience gain. Usually they are marked **Lover's Desire**. If you're not locked up with something, alleviate that need and then read the book. If you're locked into gear and can't take care of business, you'll have to weigh the benefit of reduced experience or leaving the book behind until you find another copy of it.

### I can't find my save!

Try using _Show All Saves._ Devious or Cursed Loot (one of the two) sometimes puts them in a weird place, most likely because of legacy scripts.

###  It seems like I'm about to have sex but nothing is happening. Everyone is just standing around making breathing or grunting noises.

_Skyrim Special Edition_ is not well supported yet by the _Lover's Lab_ community, or at least not as robustly. Most players seeking to use such content do so on _Oldrim_ or _Legendary Edition,_ which unfortunately suffers from an inferior engine as far as stability and memory management goes. _Legendary Edition_ is also not "officially" available on _Steam_ any longer, which discourages mainstream mod (and modlist) authors from supporting it. 

As such, animations triggered from the SE versions of _Defeat_ and _Cursed Loot_ seem to be called in a slightly different fashion than those from _SL Tools_, _SL Solutions_, or _SLEN_. They suffer from intolerable script lag at times, regardless of how many mods or animations are installed. I understand it's a known issue that is being worked on, but until it is resolved, you'll have to break your immersion a bit. If an animation seems stuck, open the console with the tilde key (`), wait for all messages to cycle, then close the console again. You may have to repeat this process a couple of times. If nothing you do gets an animation to start, post about in [Issues](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/issues).

### My arms won't go into a binder _or_ my hands are floating outside of my bindings _or_ my gag won't go in my mouth _or_ one of these is true for an NPC.

Most commonly this is because you added animations without rerunning Nemesis. Figure out how to do that and do it because I don't support the addition of animations because there are already 17,000 in this list. 

If that's not it, if you added _anything else_, remove it or rerun _Wabbajack._ 

If you didn't add anything, there's not much I can do. _Devious_ handling of these matters is extremely finicky in its original version on Oldrim and even more so for Special Edition. Facial Expressions in Special Edition have always been a problem (leading to unopened mouths with gags, for example) and the NPC arm / invisible hands problem persists to this day no matter which version you use. If you want a more bug-free game, don't use _Devious Devices_. 

IF something really terrible happens and won't stop (animations always wrong, or being trapped in something you can't see in your inventory) you basically have two options.

1. Load the game from before the bug happened.
2. If that doesn't work, rerun Wabbajack and play SexLab without Devious Devices support.

**NEVER** use the _"Safe Word" (FREE ME)_ in the _Cursed Loot_ debug menu. Find a way out of your restraints as intended instead. "FREE ME" basically forces all the scripts to terminate prematurely and all the devices to force off with console commands and will probably cause more problems than it solves. It is mainly intended for testing. If you find yourself wanting to do this very often, reconsider why you are playing with Cursed Loot.

### My body shows that I'm wearing a Devious Device, I suffer all the effects from it, but it's not in my inventory so I can't remove it!

Your device bugged out. Reload from before you got equipped with it. If you don't want these kinds of problems, disable Cursed Loot. If it keeps happening with the _exact same device_ and you haven't added _anything_ to the modlist, post about it in [Issues](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/issues) 

### I'm just gonna use debug menus or console commands to remove stuff I don't want on me anymore.

First, evaluate if _Cursed Loot_ is really something you want to play _Skyrim_ with. If it is, don't use debug menus or console commands to avoid the purpose of the mod. It only makes things worse over time. If something is so horribly bugged that you can't do anything at all about it, load your game before the problem appeared. If you find yourself doing this a lot, you probably thought _Cursed Loot_ was a cool idea for you but it really isn't.

###  I'm locked into some gear and I can't move in third person.

_Devious Devices_ doesn't like the SE version of _Immersive First Persion View_ very much. Don't disable IFPV after enabling it or you will get this bug every time you stop moving while in restrictive gear. If you were unaware of this fact, save your game, reload, and the problem should go away. Don't enable _Immersive First Person View_ while locked up unless you plan to stay in first person.

### I'm using Cursed Loot and I'm in such an incredible amount of bondage gear that I can't do anything at all!

Time to reload a save before you got into that situation. Seriously, if there were an option to prevent nested equipping of Devious Devices I would enable it. But there isn't. Not without disabling most of the hilariously meme-worthy scenarios. If you get equipped in anything extremely punishing, I recommend reloading your game if anything else really punishing gets equipped on you. Unless you just want to see how ridiculous things can get.

## Gameplay

### I was locked up in the "princess" start and something defeated me and I got teleported somewhere and the quest was completely broken! This isn't fair!

Life isn't fair and _Cursed Loot_ doubles down on that. Seriously, though, there are a couple of weird spawn areas that can be troublesome with _Immersive Patrols_. Be sure to save your game before exiting the hideout either time and hope you don't get a mob spawn nearby or at Sarethi farm.

### I can't find those damn keys in the "slave princess" start!

They are non-existent until triggered. The _hideout key_ spawns outside on a random slaver corpse after you are free from the cage. You must search every body until you find it. I will tell you that the bodies are all near the road and do not go beyond the man on the ledge on one extreme or the man in the weeds (near the ridgeline, he's kinda hard to see) on the other, so keep checking. The _office key_ spawns when you search the body of the Slaver Boss and read the note pop-up. Search every corpse and chest in the room until you find it. If you can't find it at first, keep searching until you do. I have never had an instance where it didn't show (and I have tested it many, many, _many_ times)

### Where the hell do I go after Chloe tells me about the secret passage?

Go back out the way you came and to the cave where Ralof and Hadvar are. The main quest may break if you go through _Cursed Loot's_ "narrow passage" shortcut and the _Unofficial Patch_ makes sure to warn you about it, so I have removed that option. Go all the way back in the cave until you get to the room with the spiders, kill them (or let Chloe do it, she's a beast) and search the Imperials in there for a _Torn Note_. Read the note. _Don't worry about the quest pointer for this, it's useless. Go find the Imperial corpse with the _Torn Note_.

### OK so I was about to have sex and I teleported into the sky and dropped into a Giant Camp (or somewhere else wierd)

Sex outside (in the overworld) is buggy with SexLab Privacy. You can disable it if you want. It's at position 122 in the load order. Keep in mind if you disable it with _Cursed Loot_ you won't be prompted to hide from the guard before having sex and they may nab you.

### I was bound and then defeated and then teleported somewhere and now I can't get up from the ground!

Wait 30 seconds, save, wait 30 more seconds, reload the save you just made. If this doesn't allow you to stand up, you'll have to load a game from before you were defeated.

### I tried to seduce somebody and they turned me down, dissed me, then attacked me and raped me!

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
