## Content

### What gives? I want creatures! Where is Cursed Loot? Where is the roleplay? This is too softcore!

Boy did you ever download the wrong list. This list is mostly for playing Skyrim with titties in it. For more hardcore content, check out the _Tsukiro_ modlist, also available on my server. You might also await the champion ForgottenGlory's big upcoming NSFW modlist which will have more of Lover's Lab's greatest hits in it. If _Licentia_ is a 1 in terms of fetish content, and _Dungeons & Deviousness_ was a 10, FG's upcoming list _Masterstroke_ will be about a 6. Look forward to it!

## Gameplay

### I tried to do the vanilla intro but it is terribly messed up.

Always a risk in a heavily modded setup like this. Ideally you will choose either the "camping in the woods" start for some opening gear, or the "dumped by the wayside" start from the cabinet bookshelf for a start near Helgen with a little NSFW twist. If you absolutely MUST play the vanilla intro (I rather like it too), make sure the "Improved Camera" mod is disabled and try again. When you select the vanilla start from the statue, it takes a little while to initialize because there are so many mods in here. Before sleeping in the bed nearby, wait for Mara to finish speaking, then add maybe another ten seconds. Then try it.

### I don't know where to begin, OR I've done Skyrim so many times it's boring to me now.

I feel you. Play the _Caco Way._ **RNG** is how I make most of my decisions in life!

1. Roll a d10 to select your race.
2. Flip a coin to select your gender.
3. Roll d100 to select your weight.
4. Flip a coin to decide between a default face. If default, roll a d12 to pick one and skip the next instruction. If not continue.
5. Count the number of presets for your chosen race. Generate a random number to select one.
6. Flip to the eyes section and randomly generate one from 0 to Whatever.
7. Randomly generate the eye color as well.
8. Flip to the hair section and randomly generate one from 0 to Whatever.
9. Randomly generate the hair color as well.
10. Close RaceMenu. Use the O key to open OBody. Count the presets.
11. Generate a random number from 0 to the total. Use this OBody preset.
12. If male, randomly generate a genital size from 1.0 to 1.15. Much bigger will be too weird.
13. Generate a random number to select two perk trees. Focus all of your skills and perks in these two trees.
12. Open your inventory and flip a coin. If heads, learn the Spellsiphoning book. If tails, discard it.
13. Flip a coin. If heads, choose starting gear from the Chest in the shelf. If tails, disregard.
14. Flip a coin. If heads, randomly generate a sign from The Firmament book. If tails, disregard.
15. Flip a coin. If heads, learn a selection of starting spells from the chest in the shelf. If tails, disregard.
16. Flip a coin. If heads, take the potions from the cask. If tails, disregard.
17. Flip a coin. If heads, take the lockpicks in the corner. If tails, disregard.
18. Flip a coin. If tails, skip the next instruction. If heads, continue.
19. Flip a coin. If heads, count the list of alternate start options from the statue. Randomly generate one, then sleep in the bed.
20. Flip a coin. If heads, choose one of the sexy starts from the shelf, on the left. Start with no gear. Then sleep in the bed.
21. Flip a coin. If heads, pick up the lantern on the table and choose a prositution start. Try your damndest to make your starting gear via hooking.
22. If you have reached this stage, it is time for **CACO'S ULTIMATE RANDOMNESS** brought to you by Legendary NSFW Modder Scrab.
23. Choose nude start from the books. Drop all your gear when you spawn. Then use the Quickport power to go to a completely random location in the entire game.
24. If you can't make it, reload from the cell and try again.
25. Good luck in your **RANDO ADVENTURES!**


### I don't have one of those ancient NUMPADs! How am I gonna use OStim?

From my user _BigMac_

> If you hold F8 for 10 seconds it activates OSAs emergency rebind. Where Lshift pulls up the menu and WASD is how you nav. You can then rebind the keys manually. I use P L ; '  to nav, O and [ as yes/no and ] as toggle.

### My sex scenes won't start, or they won't end, or they get otherwise "stuck" in some way!

Something is causing the Papyrus scripting engine to back up and dump stacks. This problem is not common to everyone, but appears to affect those with older CPUs or low framerates most frequently. This is an unrecoverable error, the only solution is to load the game before the sex scenes bugged out and try to be more careful with your save. Be sure to follow best saving practices as described elsewhere in the readme, don't make heavy use of the cloud inventory systems included, and so on. I am in the process of tracking down a fix that will prevent this issue when the next revision is released. (My suspicion is a couple of badly written mods that make too many attempts at scanning the inventory.) Until that time, please be patient with me as I have returned to school and limited work and do not have as much time to dedicate to rebuilding my entire list from scratch.

### Leveling up is weird!

The prompt to level up your skills will appear after you level up. I recommend choosing your new stat (Magicka, Health, Stamina), then closing the menu, assigning your points, only to return to the perk menu and make your choices with the upgraded skills.

Still not working? The uncapper preset prevents skills from leveling beyond your level +18, to a maximum of twice your level. If your skill won't go up any further, try gaining a level!

Skill not leveling up upon reading a skill book? Make sure you're not at the cap, then check for any debuffs to skill gain on your magic effects tab. Take care of those, then try again.

### My weapons are swinging super fast or super slow!

Known bug with Skyrim when weapon speed buffs or debuffs get stacked too high. While impossible in the vanilla game, speeds with as many multipliers as my perks allow will eventually "roll over" and do the opposite. As far as I know, you can fix this by toggling the "Weapon Speed Fix" on and off in the menu for _SPERG._

### WARNING! DON'T LISTEN TO ORLANDO!

Upon entering a certain inn, you will be given the option to stab a certain Vigilant of Stendarr with a Needle. **DO NOT DO THIS.** This is basically a means by which veterans to the "VIGILANT" mod can skip 3/4 of the mod to get to the fun stuff at the end. You will be _extremely_ underpowered and _utterly_ clueless as to what is going on if you do this. **SO DON'T DO IT!!** No, there is no way back. You will have to load from before you did what the obviously evil dude told you to do.

### I can't induct members into the Blades! Or other Follower weirdness!

Sadly the follower framework I use is nowhere near as advanced as _Nether_, and I prefer not to use that one for reasons which are important to me. Search around the Discord if you're curious why. In any case, you can disable _Simple Follower Extension_ and fix issues with your followers by going to Farengar's office and clicking the little plaque to the right of his Enchanting Station.

### My follower is walking around with an exploded head! (Or other types of gore.)

The fix I installed for this doesn't always trigger. Try casting the "Maximum Mending" spell you started the game with. It removes the gore effect from all nearby NPCs.

### I love the paraglider mod, but I keep dying when I land!

Known bug I'm afraid, I guess it doesn't always perfectly detect the landing event. To prevent this, just make sure you always close and reopen the paraglider right before you land. And, of course, always save before you jump! (Wish we could do that IRL.)

### The tuning gloves in Winterhold seem to be acting up.

Try removing them and equipping them in between atempts. I dunno either, man.

### The Civil War questline is horribly messed up. I can't complete the Battle(s) of Whiterun / Solitude / Windhelm. People are inverting backwards off the ground. Enemies don't stop spawning. There's no Ulfric/Tullius!

The Civil War questline is incredibly broken even in vanilla Skyrim partially due to the large actor count and infinitely spawning enemies. Pile on CGO scripting all attack patterns and animations and Ultimate Dodge scripting all movement and you have a recipe for disaster. Even if you do manage to complete it, countless other quests will be broken due to destroyed buildings / dead NPCs / flagged variables. It's recommended that you complete this questchain near the very end of your playthrough, if at all. If you choose to do so, I recommend keeping the following things in mind:

1. Infinite enemy spawns are based around the destructible barricades. Hit them three times with a weapon or Destruction spell to destroy them and stop spawns in that area.
3. The above does not always work. If you find enemies never stop spawning, _sprint_ to the capitol building of the city you are attempting to reclaim (Dragonsreach, Castle Dour, etc) and make your way inside.
4. The conclusion of the Battle for Whiterun / Solitude / Windhelm is triggered by entering this capitol building.
5. You do not need to escort Ulfric, Galmar, Tullius, Likke or anyone else all the way to the capitol building. Sometimes they won't even spawn when you enter the city! Merely entering it yourself is enough. Just as followers appear beside you, so will the faction leaders.
6. Enjoy the rest of your horribly broken playthrough.

### I can't complete the bandit raid quest for Whiterun (or another city)

The guy who made this quest kinda made it really picky. You basically have to keep the Guard Captain alive while landing the last blow on the Bandit Leader **YOURSELF**.  Otherwise the quest will fail. No, followers or summons _do not count._ If you manage to do this without killing any NPCs, congratulations! Even if the quest fails, it should still technically "complete" and remove itself from your quest log. If it doesn't, you're just going to have to keep trying it until you get it. It seems to be rather buggy. I recommend buffing or armoring up and charging out in front of the guards before those damn fools get themselves killed.

### I'm trying to kill the Necromancers for Undeath and the quest won't complete.

Yeah, this is just a buggy part of this mod, at least when included in a large modlist like this. After clearing the ritual site, try opening console and typing `killall`. That should clear the quest. If that doesn't work, highlight the dead Necromancers and type `resurrect` followed by `killall.` If this STILL doesn't work, you will probably have to repeat this portion until it does.

### I can't find the attack site that Lan describes in Riverwood.

Another victim of the overmodding problem. You're not crazy, the mod is not malicious, sometimes Skyrim's Story Manager doesn't spawn the site. It would be very easy to find if it had spawned. Just find the Roadside Ruins South of Lake Illanata and wander around until you run into a pack of wolves attacking a Nord woman. Fight them off, and you will be able to continue the Quest.

### I set OStim to Auto Mode and things got weird.

Auto Mode is a work in progress. I recommend leaving it disabled completely, even for "aggressive" scenes. It has a tendency to get locked up in a solo animation, a kissing animation, not progress to later steps in the scene, among other issues. I'm sure it will improve over time.

## Technical

### I crashed!

Slow down there pardner. Skyrim crashes all the time, less so in vanilla but more so with over 700 mods. First make sure it crashes the next time you do the exact same thing. If it does, drop by the support channels on Discord and give as much detail as possible and I'll fix it.

### I'm randomly crashing!

You probably don't have enough paged RAM. Skyrim is very badly optimized. Try increasing your pagefile size. Refer to the primary README document for details. 

### As soon as I start the game in the main "overworld" everybody starts spinning around and collapsing at the speed of light!

This happens sometimes to some people when the framerate is not capped. Please ensure you copied over the _Game Folder Files_ as the main readme suggests. While you're at it, why don't you skim it again to make certain you didn't miss anything? I know it's long, but it's kind of important.

### I gave something to a follower and it crashed!

Was it less than a full stack of arrows but more than half of that stack of arrows? Yeah, this is a bug and can't be fixed. Don't do that!

If it was something else, first launch the game and try it again. If it happens again report it and tell me which item it was!

### I have problems with the camera! Flickering, weird 1st person body clipping! Can't switch to 3rd person!

These are all caused by the extremely janky customization that makes first person POV sex under OStim a possibility. You are probably better off disabling both "Improved Camera" and the "Improved Camera INI" in the left pane of MO2. They do not have traditional ESPs, so your save will be fine. For a compromise, you can switch _to_ third person with the "F" key, and _back_ to first person with the scroll wheel. yes it is quite jank

### My performance is really terrible, low FPS, input lag during combat!

Your CPU or GPU are probably too weak. Head over to my Discord server and check the pins. 

### I have a bug that's not in this list.

The best way to get it looked at is to submit it to [Issues](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/issues). It's a list, I remember lists, I don't remember or sometimes even notice other things.

If you don't want to do that, I'm not going to be particularly strict about this since people have many reasons to avoid creating yet another account somewhere. So just drop by Discord. If I see it and it's not a known issue I'll try to help.

### I added a mod (or mods) and something weird happened.

Feed free to stop by my private server and talk about it. I'm usually in a good mood and willing to help unless you did something crazy like add seven huge quest mods, all available patches for those mods, and all available LOTD patches for those mods and their patches. Then you're on your own! You can always browse _Lively's Learn To Mod Series_ to get info on how to change any modlist you want. Just if you're going to lose your mind about it and try to pile on 50 SexLab mods try not to bother anyone else about it yeah?

https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod

### There's more than 255 ESPs! Will this thing even launch?

Yes. ESPs flagged as ESL don't count. Double click the little number to see how many real ESPs there are.

### My load order got messed up!

I have included backups. Click the swirly arrows. There's one for the load order (right pane) and one for the install order (left pane). Be sure to get the most recent one!

### I crash in Project AHO when I complete a certain quest!

Try this. Load before you start the quest's conclusion. Complete a step. Save. Reload. Complete the next step. Continue until you finish the quest without crashing. I have confirmation that this does work.

### I can't take two steps in Lucien's final dungeon without freezing or crashing!

Lucien's final dungeon has a TON of custom models and assets that are quite demanding even WITHOUT the massive texture overhauls of _Licentia_. I have already installed the only mod created to resolve this issue by adding more occlusion planes to hide non-visible objects. My recommendation to you is to either disable all 4K Texture mods temporarily (except those with ESPs -- look inside the mod folder) and also disable the _SmoothCam_ mod. Hopefully this fixes your problem, otherwise, I'm afraid I don't know what to do as these freezes seem related to weird system configurations. My team members were able to push through the dungeon even with the crashes by carefully staring at the ground and using _Whirlwind Sprint_ in the worst areas, but they are _extremely_ determined!

### My quests have started to disappear from my Quest Log.

Skyrim uses a very tiny variable to keep track of these. The maximum number of quests you can have, both active **AND COMPLETED,** cannot exceed 255. When this happens, the older quests will start to vanish. _There is no way around this limitation, it is hard-coded into the game._ If you somehow find yourself playing the hundreds of hours required to do this many quests, read and follow the directions in this mod when you first notice the problem: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56130  You can also find a Synthesis / Mutagen version of this Quest Recovery tool if you are more advanced. There is also a Quest Recover MCM you can run to get the missing quests back.
