# CACO'S COMPREHENSIVE MOD GUIDE

## For Mods Primarily in _Licentia_ (But Also In Other Lists)

### Core Gameplay Mods

### Visual Mods

#### Parallax

- Project Parallax Revived
- Skyrim 2020 Parallax
- Illustrious Whiterun SE
- A Whiterun - Parallax
- Whiterun Mesh Fixes

_Licentia_ is one of the earliest modlists to implement most of the currently-avaiable high quality parallax meshes and textures to a Skyrim modlist as of this writing. What is parallax you may ask? Well, it's sort of like an optical illusion that makes smaller, rather plain objects distort in such a way while moving to appear as though they have depth and weight they do not really have. Think of those old SNES or arcade games you use to play that had multiple levels of scrolling in the background -- that's parallax. Apply that to a sphere to make it look crumbly or a block to make it look ridged and you have the FPS equivalent.

### Animation Mods

- FNIS - Fores New Idles in Skyrim **(REPLACED BY THE FOLLOWING)**
- Project New Reign - Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine

This is a straight up successor to _FNIS._ Anytime you read anything about _FNIS_, just substitute _Nemesis_ for it because that's what this mod does in its place. It adds a bunch of engine level abilities to animations so they don't have to run through Papyrus to work, originally meant for dodges and combat animations so they wouldn't be affected by FPS or script delay. The only thing lacking is creature support, no mods with creature animations will work with Nemesis. It will be developed at some point, as soon as the melee combat fanatics get around to creating new attacks for all the monsters of Skyrim as well.

- Simple Dual Sheath

Twin blood drenched greatswords crossed across a hot comic book babe's backside. Nuff said.

### Chargen Tweak Mods

- Alternate Start
- New Beginnings
- Books of Dibella

Everybody knows **Arthmoor's** _Alternate Start._ It lets you skip the cart ride. _New Beginnings_ adds tons more options to it, some of which harder than fuck, and _Books of Dibella_ adds some where you start out in little more than your birthday suit. If I ever get a random spawner working I'll probably offer that as well, because naked, spell-less and gearless in a random place is my preferred way to begin.
 
- Abandoned Prison Tweaks

This mod, stolen shamelessly from _Lotus_, removes the starting spells and gear and substitutes them with a cabinet and a hidden lockbox you can pick and choose from to better tweak out your initial character design.

### Optimization Mods

- eFPS - Exterior FPS Boost

Ever notice how the more crowded an area is with "stuff", the more more laggy your game is? Riverwood, Whiterun and Falkreath are prime examples. JK's Skyrim is one of the biggest offenders when it comes to additions. Skyrim is decidedly missing in "occlusion planes" like a lot of modern games have, which basically deletes things when you aren't looking at them so they don't use up processing power. This mod adds a lot of these "occlusion planes" all over the place and are very difficult to use in complex setups such as Wabbajack lists because, unless they are perfect, stuff will appear and disappear while you're moving around. I solve this problem by keeping my town and world edits to a minimum.

### Major Core Mods

- SSE Engine Fixes

Basically makes the whole game be less crappy. Memory management is better, large modlists work better, crashes happen less often, fewer freezes and infinite load screens, an all around fantastic mod.

- SSE Display Tweaks

Does what Engine Fixes does for the visual output. If you change something like resolution or scaling or VSYNC in the INI's and it does nothing -- check this mod, often its values are overwriting the defaults. A truly fantastic piece of work.

- SSE Gameplay Tweaks
- powerofthree's Tweaks
- Scrambled Bugs
- Scrambled Eggchantments

Does what the previous two mods do for Skyrim's gameplay. Any time you encounter something weird in a list like potions worth zero gold, invisibility that drains your mana, god mode not working, console commands disabled, and other stupid stuff people feel obligated to annoy their users with, check this mod. I don't use a lot of the more innovative options because people tend to complain about them, but you can drastically change how the whole game works with little tweaks to the dozens of options in here. 

**Please note, the above mods have config files with various extensions such as TXT, INI, and/or TOML. They are all preferably opened with Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code, both free apps. Remember that configuring the above mods on your own violates _Rule 11_ and should only be discussed in the modification-friendly support areas for your chosen modlist.**

- Spell Perk Item Distributor

An astonishing mod that can add stuff to NPCs like spells, perks, or items with a simple line item entry. Not as useful as you might think though, because a quirk of how Skyrim determines enemy levels prevents the level-dependent options from working properly on most modlist enemies. I only use it for preventing friendly fire.

### Minor Core Mods

- MCM Recorder

Included mostly for convenience to my users. If you have a certain set of MCM options you want to make every new game, you can record them with this mod. Nobody ever really thought something like this would ever exist, but here it is. It works well for the most part, except mods that require you to exit and re-enter the MCM cannot be recorded.

- No Silly Physics Damage

Notice how you don't die walking through piles of bones anymore? Yeah, this mod fixes that stupid bug.

- Vanilla Script (micro)Optimizations

These are small changes to Bethesda's Papyrus scripts to make them faster and more efficient. They are probably barely noticeable in a standard modlist but can make a big difference in heavy NSFW lists such as _Licentia._ As **subhuman**, the creator of this mod, famously said: all Papyrus optimization is for _hornymodding_ in the end.

- JContainers

I don't really know what this is or why it's so great but EggyPapp the Papyrus guy says its the best thing since sliced bread.
