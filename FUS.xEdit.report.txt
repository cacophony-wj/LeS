 [06] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (0CD1CA0B) \ Magic Effect
  Most of these magic effects are not using the sound records from Immersive Sounds or Reverb Overhaul. Please ensure this is correct.
 
 [06] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (0CD1CA0B) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 0001434B <Dagny>
  AI Overhaul value is overwritten.
  
 [06] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (0CD1CA0B) \ Region \ 0010FDC6 <WeatherWinterhold>
  The weather changes here have been reverted to master by the CR patch.
   
 [06] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (0CD1CA0B) \ Weapon \ 00058F5E <BoundWeaponBattleaxe>
  Bound sound effect overwritten. Please ensure Immersive Sounds is patched properly.
	
 [06] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (0CD1CA0B) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 000092F5 <UstengravExterior01>
  Does RWT even have a purpose if most of its values are overwritten by the SkyVRAAN patcher?
	 
 [35] Lux.esp (B0F9620D) \ Light \ 0003FA58 <MagicLightLightSpell01>
  Not really sure what's going on with Magelight here but it appears the mods you have added to make it brighter have been overwritten.

 [3F] AI Overhaul.esp (973A774C) \ Non-Player Character (Actor)
  It appears some of the AI overhaul packages are overwritten by RSChildren.

 [41] Immersive Sounds - Compendium.esp (5426346A) \ Magic Effect
  Again with the magic effects not using Immersive Sounds. Please ensure this is correct.

 [44] Inigo.esp (AA81318C) \ Cell \ 00052FEB <Kagrenzel01>
  If these records here are persistent they probably need to be for one of Inigo's quests.
		
 [4C] BladeAndBlunt.esp (816ED2A1) \ Movement Type
  I'm going to assume the reverting of these movement records is intentional due to some quirk of Skyrim VR.
		 
 [50] Marc.esp (4A46E687) \ Container \ 00078C0C <MerchantRiverwoodTraderChest>
  I guess this is a balance concern? You don't want Lucan to have the Arcane Archery stuff? Geez, you're no fun.
