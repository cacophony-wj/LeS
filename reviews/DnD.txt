				WARNING! DELETED NAVMESH BY Deviously Cursed Loot.esp
		
OVERALL NOTE
There are many navmesh conflicts in this modlist. I am a rank noob when it comes to resolving them,
but consider examining the most severe conflicts in the CK to ensure that NPCs and followers do not 
behave strangely. JD is particularly expert at this. Alternately, COC to an affected cell and drag
a follower around and about for a minute or two. Also, in some cases, Door Triangles from one mod are 
altered or outright blanked by a later one. Consider examining these in detail if you haven't already.

OVERALL NOTE
I am not certain how all the magic and perk overhauls are supposed to relate to each other, but they
all appear to have been arranged with care. I lack the capability to comment on any inconsistencies.
You might wish to glance over records from Mysticism, Adamant, Sustained Magic, and Combat Evolveed to
ensure everything is as you wish.

	Race
		000131F0			DremoraRace

		I don't know what to do with all the blanked makeups and warpaints from Sakora's and EVW.
		I didn't know what to do with them in mine and I don't know what to do with them here.

	Cell
		00016778			WindhelmHjerim
			000A2C96		Hjerim
			A marker for a spouse bed from this mod is blanked by Spouses Enhanced. I have noticed this to be
			true of Spouses Enhanced for many spouse bed markers, so perhaps this is intentional.
	Worldspace
		0000003C			Tamriel
		GENERAL NOTE: Many of the persistence flags on Placed Objects added by 3DNPC are blanked by later ESPs.
					  These may be quest-related?	

Forgotten DungeonsSSE.esm
	Non-Player Character (Actor)
		000B6002			Forgottenhagnestpaaboss
		Most of the unique adjustments by this mod to this boss have been reverted by More Nasty Critters.

	GENERAL NOTE: All most all of this mod's conflicts are overwritten. I am uncertain as to its purpose.

	Race
		000131FD			HorseRace
			The patched audio effect for the "horse punch" is reverted by later ESPs.
	Region
	GENERAL NOTE: It appears that this entire section needs significant consistency reworking. ESPs intended to patch
				  Obsidian Weathers for True Storms and AOS are being overwritten by the Aequinoctium Addon.
	Weapon
		0006A13C			MGRKeening
			The audio record from this mod is not being carried forward.

Mortal Enemies.esp
	Race
	GENERAL NOTE: It appears that most of the conflicting records here have data about movement and attacks overwritten
				  by More Nasty Critters in some cases, which surely is not desired, or Growl, which surely is.
	
Treeswinedave.esp
	Worldspace
		0000003C			Tamriel
			0000BC97
				The Location keyword from SMSkyrim is being blanked by this mod.

Enemy Variations V4 - NPCs.esp
	Leveled NPC
		0003DF16			LCharBanditBoss
			It appears that the Leveled List for this boss is being overwritten by Sanguine.
	Race
	GENERAL NOTE: I didn't know what to do with the plethora of facepaints and warpaints in my own list and I don't know
				  to do with them here. Godspeed, lewd emperor.

MysticismMagic.esp
	Magic Effect
		I see now that most of your audio records are coming from ISC which was part of a previously hidden modgroup.
		
BlackthornManor.esp
	GENERAL NOTE: There appear to be significant conflicts with this mod and Kaidan, especially when it comes to navmeshes
				  and reference markers. The navmeshes don't concern me as much as the reference markers, given that some
				  of your users mentioned an inability to access certain areas on your LS2 Discord server (IIRC)

SkyRem Merged.esp
	Ingredient
	GENERAL NOTE: Some of the keywords identifying these as vendor ingredients appear to be blanked by GOLD.esp, among other
				  later mods.
				  
RealisticNeedsandDiseases.esp

	GENERAL NOTE: The statistical values look good but the watercolor values are mostly being reverted by RND's patches.

CFTO.esp	
	Non-Player Character (Actor)
		The faction values added by the mod appear to have been blanked by later ESPs.
	
Deviously Cursed Loot.esp
	I notice you're not using mine or Umgak's DCUR patches. Highly recommend you consider including them. You can get them
	from LeS or Lotus, or I could just send them if you so desire :) They fix things like Dawnstar navmeshes and flickering lighting.
	Worth a gander at least.
	
DeviousFollowers.esp
	Non-Player Character (Actor)
		The priest faction added to some NPCs by this mod is being blanked by later ESPs.

	GENERAL NOTE: The skins for your horses are overwritten by MNC.
	
Qw_DeadlySpellImpacts_AOS Patch.esp

		000D7FBB	AbSkeleton
			It seems that this mod should be winning this conflict.
			
VisualAnimatedEffects.esp
	Object Effect
	GENERAL NOTE: The effects appear to be overwritten here.
	
Dr_Bandolier.
	GENERAL NOTE: Please ensure that none of the left Imperial pouches use Slot 52 as that will conflict with SOS.

	GENERAL NOTE: The Nightingale set from Awesome Artifacts appears to be reverted here.
	
Qw_ISC_USSEP Patch.esp
	GENERAL NOTE: The values for summoning Atronachs as in Sustained Magic appear to be reverted here.
	
Alternate Start -- New Beginnings.esp
	SUGGESTION: Blank the dialog topics related to vampires, they do not function properly with Sacrosanct. This includes
				the Skooma Addict one.
				
OCW_CellSettings.esp
	Cell
		000CAB91 			WinterholdCollegeHallofAttainment
			Reverted to ELE values.
		
GOLD.esp
	Ingestible
	Ingredient
	Misc. Item
