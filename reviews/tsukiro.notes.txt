 [05] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp \ Armor 
 
 It seems to me that the item names that MLU assigns to the dragon masks should be forwarded.
 Likewise, there are several records here where sound values from ISC are missing.
 Consider checking the results of your patchers more closely.
 Also, several values from RoM are overwritten by the ISC patch for LOTD.
 
 [05] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp \ Armor 
 
 A couple of lights that are disabled by your Great Town overhauls are enabled again by Lux.
 Consider checking all your lighting records.
 Also, oddly enough, a couple bird eggs are deleted by goodbrother.esp.
 Consider cleaning that mod, or undeleting and disabling these references yourself.

 [05] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (A7FF3241) \ Idle Animation \ 00100F18 <KillingMoveSneakBackA00>
  
 You need TUDM - VioLens patch badly. The record changes are not obvious ones.

 [05] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (A7FF3241) \ Leveled Item
 
 Do you want MLU or LORA to win for these? Because some of the patching is inconsistent.
 
 [05] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (A7FF3241) \ Non-Player Character (Actor)
 
 Looking good. It's rare that I don't find at least one overwritten death script record for the named NPCs.
 I didn't comb over all these for BFBs because the conflicts are few and none have been reported in our server.
 
 [05] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (A7FF3241) \ Race
 
 Great! Race records look good.
 ...but seriously, fuck wenches!
 
 [05] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (A7FF3241) \ Weapon
 
 Looks like Audio Overhaul is reverting some MLU changes, which is probably not what you want.
 
 [06] Skyrim Project Optimization - Full Version.esm (82E85A91) \ Cell \ 0001678C <WindhelmWhitePhial> \ 0007D21F
 
 Pretty sure this needs to stay disabled.
 
 [FE 001] Landscape and Water Fixes.esp (9652F8D8) 
 
 Great portions of this are being overwritten wholesale. While expected due to the city and town overhauls, you may wish to double-check.
 I know for example the good brotherhood mod is deleting several references outright.
 
 [12] Vigilant.esm (378F74EA) \ Cell \ 0001677A <WindhelmBloodworks> \ 000D283C
 
 URGENT! A door triangle apparently leading to a Vigilant dungeon has been overwritten.
 The navmesh will need to be regenerated / finalized in the CK.
 
 [13] Glenmoril.esm (6053DD79) \ Cell \ 00016D72 <MarkarthWarrens> \ 00016F5D
 [13] Glenmoril.esm (6053DD79) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 00009CA0 \ 000EC469
 
 URGENT! Same here, except for Glenmoril.
 
 [19] SaveTheIcerunner.esp (F57050CB) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 00013268 <Deeja>
 [19] SaveTheIcerunner.esp (F57050CB) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 0001328D <JareeRa>
 
 It seems as though you need to forward the perks for Deeja & Jareera. They are being overwritten by High Poly NPCs.
 
 [29] LoS II - Tamriel Master Lights.esp (EB9AB95B) \ Leveled Item \ 000A6E7A <CWSoldierSonsGear>
 
 It appears as though this NPC has duplicated missile weapons.
 
 [FE 018] High Poly NPC Overhaul - Skyrim Special Edition.esp (15710A81)
 
 Fuck wenches.
 
 [31] Book of UUNP Iron And Steel.esp (3CA01386) \ Leveled Item
 
 Some of these are missing the UUNP crafting recipe books, unless this is intentional.
 Also, the sublists from UUNP include all vanilla items, so including them among the vanilla lists results in many duplicates of non-UUNP armors. 
 This may be intended, but the overall effect is a reduced chance for Book of UUNP items.
 
 [37] goodbrother.esp (CAE0AC17) \ Cell \ 00016BD3 <RiftenHonorhallOrphanage> \ 00105485
 
 This reference has been deleted.
 
 [37] goodbrother.esp (CAE0AC17) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 00009B7A
 
 Several references here have been deleted.
 
 [FE 021] RumbleCrumble.esp (94D41C71)
 
 What's the deal with this mod? A lot of it seems to be overwritten.
 
 [9D] MLU.esp (7E34D591) \ Object Effect \ 000FEE34 <DA09EncDawnbreaker>
 
 You sure you want MLU to win this?
 
 [B9] VioLens SE.esp (010AA504) \ Idle Animation
 
 You need to verify all of these. The VL_ killmoves / records should take precedence.
