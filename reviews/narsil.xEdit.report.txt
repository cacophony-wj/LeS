
 OVERALL NOTE: Is there a reason Synthesis is reverting all of the waterflow records to DefaultWater? Maybe a VR requirement? I know VR is sort of an LE - SE hybrid, 
 and LE didn't have individual cell waterflows.
 
 OVERALL NOTE: You mentioned you were aware, but you do have quite a few unresolved navmesh conflicts in this list. Normally not a crippling problem, but I am concerned about 
 several door triangles that have been overwritten, as well as your usage of the Clockwork mod with major city overhauls. I recommend you at least take a look at the seriously 
 conflicting navmeshes in the CK if you can make heads or tails of them. You could consult #modlist-development-help or #apocrypha for detailed tips.
 
 
 [07] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (B801FEF9) \ Faction \ 00027242 <VampireFaction>
 
 A couple of the USSEP records are reverted, but this is probably not a big deal.
 
 [07] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (B801FEF9) \ Leveled Item
 
 Various of the USSEP alterations to leveled lists are ignored here, but this is probably intentional.

 [07] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (B801FEF9) \ Magic Effect \ 00073F23 <AlchDamageStaminaRavage>
 
 It appears this CACO change to a stamina poison has been completely invalidated.
 
 [07] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (B801FEF9) \ Magic Effect \ 000F3931 <PerkIntenseFlamesConfDownFFSelfArea100>
 
 Likewise with your Mod Merge and this fire effect.
 
 [07] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (B801FEF9) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 0001365F <Dravynea>
 
 It looks like AI Overhaul has been rendered useless here.
 
 [07] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (B801FEF9) \ Package \ 00083DAE <IvarsteadTembaVisitInnPackage>
 
 I don't understand the point of this ITM.
 
 [07] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (B801FEF9) \ Quest \ 0002E0EE <DialogueMorthal>
   
 Probably don't want the Smash Patch to do this?
 
 [07] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (B801FEF9) \ Quest \ 000DEE92 <WITavern>
  
 Looks like another ITM to me.
 
 [07] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (B801FEF9) \ Soul Gem \ 0002E4E4 <SoulGemLesser>
  
 Immersive sound is overwritten.
 
 [09] LegacyoftheDragonborn.esm (EA82EAD9) \ Ingestible \ 0003F4BD <WindhelmDoubleDistilledSkooma>
 
 It looks like the Skooma effect from CACO is overwritten.
 
 [09] LegacyoftheDragonborn.esm (EA82EAD9) \ Cell \ 00016BD0 <RiftenThievesGuildHeadquarters> \ 000E8F04 <TGRPitcherGuildRef>
 
 Not sure why the script here is reverted to master, but it may not be desired.
 
 [09] LegacyoftheDragonborn.esm (EA82EAD9) \ Cell \ 00035604 <IronbindBarrow01> \ 0004B475
 
 This Persistent flag probably needs to... persist.

 [09] LegacyoftheDragonborn.esm (EA82EAD9) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 0000BBE9 <DBMGreenwallSite> \ 0000CBE9
 
 You probably want LOTD's Landscape records. Smash always does weird things like this.

 Nearly all of 3DNPC's persistent flags are important and need to be forwarded or the related quests will break.
 
 [0A] 3DNPC.esp (C60DC7D3) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 00009C66 \ 000FF550
 
 A door triangle added by 3DNPC has been overwritten here.

 Looks like these navmeshes have been deleted, which is a big nono.

 You also might look over the various navmesh conflicts in this mod with the CK to see if they look OK.
 
 [24] Immersive Sounds - Compendium.esp (A1B41F75)
 
 There are many records in here that have been overwritten and seemingly ignored by the Immersive Sounds patcher. 
 Some of them are handled by your content merge which may be intentional.
 Recommend you go through this whole ESP and evaluate every conflict.
 
 [42] Point The Way.esp (CE0124EF) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 00009042 \ 000F0B07

 [42] Point The Way.esp (CE0124EF) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 00009042 \ 000F0B09
 
 There are a few deleted references like these in here, you probably want to undelete them, flag them initially disabled, and move them to Z -30000 as a best practice.

 [43] Fingerpost Fast Travel.esp (B3F96FEE) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 000093DE \ 000BB79D
 
 This sign's location is reverted by your Smash Patch.
 
 [43] Fingerpost Fast Travel.esp (B3F96FEE) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 00009AD8 \ 000EE285
 
 Deleted reference.
 
 [44] OrganicFactionsExtension.esp (B8F9C6F0) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 0000717A <MarkarthExterior01> \ 00100CEA
 
 This persistent flag is probably important.
 
 [4C] Odin - Skyrim Magic Overhaul.esp (8D8CF58D) \ Magic Effect \ 0001EA7A <ODN_Ill_Fear4_Effect_Rout>
 
 Pretty sure Immersive Sounds needs to win the sound records here.

 [86] Growl - Werebeasts of Skyrim.esp (041CC3FF) \ Perk \ 02011CFB <HRI_PerkTree_0_Perk_BestialStrength_4>
 
 It's part of a mod merge, so can only assume intentional but -- why are these deleted? Are they not referenced by anything else?
 
 [95] 018Auri.esp (165E7B6D) \ Worldspace \ 0002A9D8 <ShadowgreenCavernWorld> \ 0002A9EE \ 000E20FB
