This template was stolen with minor adustments from erri120. Just type over the non-asterisked sections with your own words.

**Describe the bug**
When wielding a bow, and the crosshair being on target, a majority of the time the arrow will go way above the target or land in the ground below the target. The 9 second video that I posted in the discord shows this, and if you pay close attention to the second arrow, the crosshair is right on the skeever, yet the arrow goes in a completely different direction than the crosshair. 

**What you were doing when the bug happened**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. I was 'outside Lund's house, but it happens in pretty much every area that I'm in. '
2. With 'forsworn, skeevers, bandits, etc.' (none is an option)
3. And shot arrows at them, testing both from level ground, above them, and slightly below them. 

**Is the bug repeatable**
Yes

**Expected behavior**
The arrow would go where I was aiming. 

**Screenshots**
If you can make the bug happen again, take a screenshot of the thing that causes it right before it happens. I highly recommend opening the console with the tilde key and clicking on the thing that has a bug. Take the screenshot with all the gobbledygook showing. Use F12 and find the latest bmp in your Skyrim folder. (Note: the Steam game folder, not the LeS directory.)

**Modlist version**
4.0.2

**Did you add any additional mods?**
No
**WARNING**
If you waste my time pretending you didn't add stuff when you did or otherwise "neglecting" to mention things you know are causing problems, I will cease all support.
