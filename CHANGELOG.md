- Updated NCK30 Animations to v2.3
- Updated Billyy's Animations to 3.4.2
- Removed Anub's Animations.
- Reduced reliance on MEGA.

### 1.3

- Removed Amorous Adventures Extended due to incompatibilities with the Dawnguard questline.
- Installed Archery Tweaks to enable greater ease targeting distant objects (I'm looking at you, _sun_)
- Patched several UUNP mage boot variants that had invisible calves (for real this time)
- There are now a wide variety of warpaints, body paints and makeups. Such a wide variety. So many.
- Attempted and abandoned MCM Automation again, I'll try it later when I work up the patience.

The increase in revision means this version is _not_ save compatible. If you want to continue your save, _do not update_.

### 1.2.7.1

- Yeah man I have no idea.

### 1.2.7.0

- Added Frenchy's makeup and paints.
- Added Frenchy's preset.
- Get to work, Frenchy!
 
### 1.2.6.1

- Fixed a couple oversights that should have been obvious. I'm too embarr'ssed to say what they were.

### 1.2.6

Updated Book of UUNP (3BBB Conversion) to 1.2.4.

### 1.2.5

- Forgot to enable _Bijin_ in _LBS_, d'oh.
- Updated _Interesting NPCs Hotfix_ to _4.3.4_
- Added _RaceMenu High Heels_ but I don't think it'll fix everything.

### 1.2.4

- Updated _Bijin AIO 2019_ to _Bijin AIO 2020_
- Updated _Smoking Torches & Candles_
  
### 1.2.3

- Installed the latest version of _CBBE 3BBB_ in an attempt to resolve a breast flattening issue while jogging / sprinting.
- Removed _360 Movement Behavior_ for the same reason.
- Fixed the custom body on a handful of custom NPCs.
- Pared back the animation count a tad, particularly for creatures.
- Created a SliderSet for another damn buggy elbowbinder variant.
 
### 1.2.2

- I have been through seven ENB's and not found a single one I like better than _Silent Horizons._ I return to it and humbly reject future suggestions.
- Added _SinfulCBP_ so players have the option to customize non-_SMP_ jiggles, particularly belly bounce. Don't like looking like a walking bowl of Jell-O? Change that here.
- Added an even larger collection of _RaceMenu_ presets with associated overlay, makeup, and eye color dependencies.
- Tweaked _Cursed Loot_ settings on both difficulties.
- Updated and revamped the README to reflect assorted changes.
  
### 1.2.1.1

- Replaced _Masculine Khajiits_ with _Better Khajiits_ to support SOS. Swapped out _Feminine Khajiits_ to match.
- Replaced _Masculine Argonians_ with _Argonian Dragonic for SOS_ for the same reason. Swapped out the feminine variant to match.
- Added a preset compilation on user request to make up for my terribad sculpting.
- Added two eye mods to support those presets. Sorry for all the eyes!

### 1.2.1

- Reworked the Leveled Lists to prevent multiple gear spawns on corpses. This _does not appear_ to be entirely possible for Helgen Keep.
- Balanced the _Cursed Loot_ alternate start to prevent a dumptruck of overpowered gear from being unloaded on the player. Corpses were practically bursting with enchanted greatswords for Chloe to use. Not to mention the conveniently placed "Berserker" gear granting huge buffs to 2-Handed skill and damage...
- Did away with BodyGen and reworked "3BBB HangEmHigh" so that preset can be used with _Cursed Loot's_ morphs.
- Adjusted the _morph_ settings so that hopefully the stomach doesn't grow to ridiculous proportions.

### 1.2

- Updated Nemesis to version 0.84c which necessitated the duplication of a ton of other folders for proper dual-profile function.
- Most importantly for the end-user, consolidated the BodySlide groups to reduce those 47 steps down to something more manageable.
- Removed "Improved Clouds and Fog" and updated required steps in the README to reflect this.
- Changed ENBs per user recommendation to Harlandson's. Not sure I like the grimdarkness of it but at least its up-to-date. May switch it out for PI-CHO if I can figure how to get rid of the shininess.
- Added more information about adding mods to the README, against my better judgment.

### 1.1.4.4

- The bogus facegen from the CK was enabled again for the men, causing BFBs in Light But Kinky. I removed them and damn it all to hell.
- Minor bugfixes and changes to bring the game settings away from my neanderthal inverted-controller-using playstyle in line with the majority of players.
- Another once-over of the readme.

### 1.1.4.3

- Reworked my light patches into the **DCUR Ultimate Light Patch** to fix the "Slave Princess" lighting once and for all.
- Disabled body morphs on both _DCUR_ configs to prevent weirdness with my presets.
- Adjusted belly bounce without much success.
- Other minor bone-headed oversights corrected, can't remember them all.
- Reworked the readme with fixes from Anonymous as well as added additional warnings and troubleshooting steps.

### 1.1.4.2

Stealth update to fix some bone-headed configuration mistakes that arose from me working on too many damn modlists at a time. I'm not going to mention them anywhere else, so if you have a problem with the version on the Wabbajack menu download this one.

### 1.1.4.1

- Forgot to enable Display Tweaks for Light But Kinky. Rather important so I'm uploading this hotfix.
- Added a neat little plugin to make sure "notes" are distinguishable from "books" in your inventory.

### 1.1.4

- Updated Legacy of the Dragonborn Patches (Official) to v2.0. The only way this will affect you is if you are collecting items from the mod Artifacts of Skyrim. One artifact is missable if not collected from a corpse before it disappears. Only update if you experience this issue.
- Updated SSE Display Tweaks to the latest version because mine was taken down. This is not a critical update either.

### 1.1.3

- Removed SSSO due to possibly incompatible save triggers near the beginning of SL scenes.
- Implemented a grass FPS fix although it may lead to less variability in grass cover density.
- Fixed an issue where footsteps could be heard while jumping.

### 1.1.2

Corrected all those damn Males of Skyrim again and spawned them all to make sure they looked good and talked to them all to make sure they didn't crash. The 2 Ulfrics shouting FusRoDah at the 2 Tulliuses made this difficult. Hopefully an ongoing Nemesis problem has been resolved as well.

### 1.1.1

Fixed a few BFBs from Males of Skyrim.

### 1.1

Corrections based on feedback from WJ's modlist testers.

### 1.0

Preparation for initial submission.

### 0.1.1

A lot of changes this time around due to problems that arose during my own testing. Please start reporting these on the issues tab, people! The main one was the installation of the standalone Creature Framework 1.1.02B to prevent certain... invisible equipment. Recommend you backup your saves before updating if you use LBK. Disabled Atlas Map Marker's overworld map to prevent fast travel that skips quest triggers. Activated several mods that should be deactivated by default, but must be active to ensure their installation by Wabbajack. Adjusted the footsteps to prevent doubling of certain sound effects. Converted a couple of plugins to Form 44 that I suspect caused crashes. Clarified options within the MCM to increase stability, compatibility, and user choice.

### 0.1.0.2

Hid the invalid script plugin leftover in MNC. This should cause no problems because the modder himself admitted he meant to remove it but forgot. Enabled the BodyGen3 folder from WJ NSFW so that it would properly download for the enduser. Changed breast physics to a more static variant to reflect possible usage of BodyGen. Disabled fast-travel to non-vanilla locations to prevent scripted event bugs. Finalized my ASLAL DCUR patch (hopefully) so there won't be any more damnable flickering in the slaver cave. Clarified instructions for BodySlide and FNIS/Nemesis in the README.

### 0.1.0.1

Downloaded and collected the metas for FNIS to ensure they would install properly for the enduser.

### 0.1

First release. The core of _Light But Sexy_ is intact, with a bunch of worldspace removals to prevent save bloat. Also, the universe's most-hated mod, _Combat Gameplay Overhaul_ is in for no other reason than I like playing with it. It's not Smashed or Mastered to anything so if you would prefer not to use it just disable it. The option is also here to use FNIS with Nemesis for creature animations and CGO, Nemesis or FNIS without CGO, as well as switching MO2 profiles to _Light But Kinky_ for Cursed Loot to resolve incompatibilities which cannot be accomplished in any other way.
