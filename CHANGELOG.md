- Found yet ANOTHER reason Meridia was a naked woman and hopefully fixed it!
- Fixed a ridiculous amount of broken NPCs!
- Updated _Faster HDT SMP_ to 1.18
- Updated _OStim Solutions_ to Beta 5
- Updated _Vokriinator Black_ to 6.8.0
- Updated _Adamant_ to 5.3.5
- Updated _Attack Dogs_ to 1.1.5k
- Still haven't pulled the trigger on a cat mod.
- I'll get the new _OSex_ animations by ace in there eventually.

### 10.26.3

- Added _Gray Quarter Apartment_
- Added _Buyable Home Patch for Elysium Estate SSE_
- Removed _Beginner's Shack - Starter Home_
- Removed _Ruska - Riften Player Home_
- Removed _Sicarius' Refuge SSE - A Hitman's Hideout_

### 10.26.2 

Can't stop, won't stop. Decided to add a few player home options to the UI profile and well, maybe got a little carried away.
Will probably compile this after a little more testing, for distribution on this server as a "test" version.

- Abandoned my research into custom physics XMLs. None are as good as the defaults.
- Replaced _HDT Skinned Mesh Physics_ with _Faster HDT-SMP_
- Changed my mind on the grass mod. The LOD transition is actually WAY better. As far as I am concerned, it is worth the substantial tradeoff in grass quality. The new grass is also FAR more performance-friendly.
- Added craft-only _Girl's Heavy Armors SE_
- Added a **small** collection of _BD's Armor Replacers_ and listed them as "sexy" variants that you can purchase at a premium from Khajiit caravans.
- Added official support for _Book of UUNP_, skimpy edition. They will likely be uncommon enough to avoid most complaints.
- Officially added _Elysium Estate_. Pending, need to check for conflicts in all profiles.
- Added a collection of Elianora homes listed below.
- Added _Beginner's Shack - Starter Home_
- Added _Eli's Breezehome_
- Added _The Rookery - Bard and Thief Loft in Solitude_

### 10.26.1b

Preliminary UI version is completed. The following changes were made:

- Still experimenting with SMP and CBPC configs.
- Attempting to track down why killmoves are still happening against the player.
- Added _Masque of Clavicus Vile 4K_
- Added back _No Grass In Objects_
- Added back _Grass FPS Booster_
- Replaced _Veydosebrome Regions_ with _Cathedral Landscapes._
- Updated _Synthesis_ to 0.21.4
- Fixed several small bugs reported in my server.
- Regenerated much more performant LODs with grass LOD option (for the horrid transition)
- Reran BodySlides
- Reran Nemesis
- Reran Synthesis

Will possibly compile a version for my team sometime before dawn, but doubt they will have time to test it...

### 10.26.1a

### 10.7

The big removal here is _ODefeat._ It doesn't like my camera setup, it doesn't play well with _Maximum Carnage_, and both of those are more important to me. Player victim also cannot be disabled if something goes wrong. Also, quite significantly, it engenders a lot of confusion and complaints from users, so it has to go. If you disagree with this or any other removals, please keep such discussions to my private server available from the readme or various links on _Wabbajack's_ primary server. Most of them are relatively simple to add back. I am also on a continuous hunt for "neck seams." If you find any, inform me, but be prepared for a salty caco because they make me angry.

- Fixed seams on the _Bijins_ (again), also
- Reverted Adrianne to her _Northbourne_ variant because the seam APPEARS to be part of the original mod.
- Updated _OComfort_ to 1.2
- Updated _OStrap_ to 1.2.4
- Added _NL-MCM_ since _OStrap_ stopped including it.
- Updated _Fertility Mode Fixes & Tweaks_ to 2.24
- Updated _On A Crimson Trail_ to 1.1
- Updated _Vanilla Script (micro)Optimizations_ to 1.1a

The below mods seemed like good ideas for some reason but actually were not. I learned some of this before but apparently completely forgot about it.

- Removed _Sanguine Blood ReTexture SE_ for being too red.
- Removed _No Edge Glow - Magic and Transformations_ because it's kinda important to see who has buffs before you attack them.

I thought it would be cool if 10% of Skyrim had powerful perks. One of them was a perk that reflects damage from melee killmoves at the player so they instantly die. No thanks! However, it may have been an altered perk from _Vokriinator_ and not exactly intended. Complain enough and I'll try a compromise.

- Removed _Shouty People of Skyrim_
- Removed _Adamant Perks for NPCs_
- Removed _Vokrii Perks for NPCs_
- Removed _Ordinator Perks for Spell Perk Item Distributor_
- Removed _Enemy (R)Evolution of Skyrim_

I also thought it would be cool to have random encounters. After three Wisps spawned on me in Whiterun and downed almost everyone, I decided the Genesis guy does not want to play the same game I do. 

- Removed _Genesis Unleashed_
- Removed _Genesis Surface Spawns_

How the hell did I get here?

- The most significant change is the two profiles.
- "Licentia et Servitium" has no fetish content and uses Nemesis for CGO and TUDM, mainly with a controller.
- "Servitium" includes all the fetish content and uses FNIS to make the best use of it.
- I solved my music problem. I also discovered my mental age is 14.
- Switched the ENB to PI-CHO with a special LUT. Add the Subsurface fix for better-looking skin. Copy over game folder files if you want it.

## 3.0

## 2.0.0.2

- Introduced, then fixed, a problem with a UI interface causing crashes on launch.

- Updated NCK30 Animations to v2.3
- Updated Billyy's Animations to 3.4.2
- Removed Anub's Animations.
- Reduced reliance on MEGA.

### 1.3

- Removed Amorous Adventures Extended due to incompatibilities with the Dawnguard questline.
- Installed Archery Tweaks to enable greater ease targeting distant objects (I'm looking at you, _sun_)
- Patched several UUNP mage boot variants that had invisible calves (for real this time)
- There are now a wide variety of warpaints, body paints and makeups. Such a wide variety. So many.
- Attempted and abandoned MCM Automation again, I'll try it later when I work up the patience.

The increase in revision means this version is _not_ save compatible. If you want to continue your save, _do not update_.

### 1.2.7.1

- Yeah man I have no idea.

### 1.2.7.0

- Added Frenchy's makeup and paints.
- Added Frenchy's preset.
- Get to work, Frenchy!
 
### 1.2.6.1

- Fixed a couple oversights that should have been obvious. I'm too embarr'ssed to say what they were.

### 1.2.6

Updated Book of UUNP (3BBB Conversion) to 1.2.4.

### 1.2.5

- Forgot to enable _Bijin_ in _LBS_, d'oh.
- Updated _Interesting NPCs Hotfix_ to _4.3.4_
- Added _RaceMenu High Heels_ but I don't think it'll fix everything.

### 1.2.4

- Updated _Bijin AIO 2019_ to _Bijin AIO 2020_
- Updated _Smoking Torches & Candles_
  
### 1.2.3

- Installed the latest version of _CBBE 3BBB_ in an attempt to resolve a breast flattening issue while jogging / sprinting.
- Removed _360 Movement Behavior_ for the same reason.
- Fixed the custom body on a handful of custom NPCs.
- Pared back the animation count a tad, particularly for creatures.
- Created a SliderSet for another damn buggy elbowbinder variant.
 
### 1.2.2

- I have been through seven ENB's and not found a single one I like better than _Silent Horizons._ I return to it and humbly reject future suggestions.
- Added _SinfulCBP_ so players have the option to customize non-_SMP_ jiggles, particularly belly bounce. Don't like looking like a walking bowl of Jell-O? Change that here.
- Added an even larger collection of _RaceMenu_ presets with associated overlay, makeup, and eye color dependencies.
- Tweaked _Cursed Loot_ settings on both difficulties.
- Updated and revamped the README to reflect assorted changes.
  
### 1.2.1.1

- Replaced _Masculine Khajiits_ with _Better Khajiits_ to support SOS. Swapped out _Feminine Khajiits_ to match.
- Replaced _Masculine Argonians_ with _Argonian Dragonic for SOS_ for the same reason. Swapped out the feminine variant to match.
- Added a preset compilation on user request to make up for my terribad sculpting.
- Added two eye mods to support those presets. Sorry for all the eyes!

### 1.2.1

- Reworked the Leveled Lists to prevent multiple gear spawns on corpses. This _does not appear_ to be entirely possible for Helgen Keep.
- Balanced the _Cursed Loot_ alternate start to prevent a dumptruck of overpowered gear from being unloaded on the player. Corpses were practically bursting with enchanted greatswords for Chloe to use. Not to mention the conveniently placed "Berserker" gear granting huge buffs to 2-Handed skill and damage...
- Did away with BodyGen and reworked "3BBB HangEmHigh" so that preset can be used with _Cursed Loot's_ morphs.
- Adjusted the _morph_ settings so that hopefully the stomach doesn't grow to ridiculous proportions.

### 1.2

- Updated Nemesis to version 0.84c which necessitated the duplication of a ton of other folders for proper dual-profile function.
- Most importantly for the end-user, consolidated the BodySlide groups to reduce those 47 steps down to something more manageable.
- Removed "Improved Clouds and Fog" and updated required steps in the README to reflect this.
- Changed ENBs per user recommendation to Harlandson's. Not sure I like the grimdarkness of it but at least its up-to-date. May switch it out for PI-CHO if I can figure how to get rid of the shininess.
- Added more information about adding mods to the README, against my better judgment.

### 1.1.4.4

- The bogus facegen from the CK was enabled again for the men, causing BFBs in Light But Kinky. I removed them and damn it all to hell.
- Minor bugfixes and changes to bring the game settings away from my neanderthal inverted-controller-using playstyle in line with the majority of players.
- Another once-over of the readme.

### 1.1.4.3

- Reworked my light patches into the **DCUR Ultimate Light Patch** to fix the "Slave Princess" lighting once and for all.
- Disabled body morphs on both _DCUR_ configs to prevent weirdness with my presets.
- Adjusted belly bounce without much success.
- Other minor bone-headed oversights corrected, can't remember them all.
- Reworked the readme with fixes from Anonymous as well as added additional warnings and troubleshooting steps.

### 1.1.4.2

Stealth update to fix some bone-headed configuration mistakes that arose from me working on too many damn modlists at a time. I'm not going to mention them anywhere else, so if you have a problem with the version on the Wabbajack menu download this one.

### 1.1.4.1

- Forgot to enable Display Tweaks for Light But Kinky. Rather important so I'm uploading this hotfix.
- Added a neat little plugin to make sure "notes" are distinguishable from "books" in your inventory.

### 1.1.4

- Updated Legacy of the Dragonborn Patches (Official) to v2.0. The only way this will affect you is if you are collecting items from the mod Artifacts of Skyrim. One artifact is missable if not collected from a corpse before it disappears. Only update if you experience this issue.
- Updated SSE Display Tweaks to the latest version because mine was taken down. This is not a critical update either.

### 1.1.3

- Removed SSSO due to possibly incompatible save triggers near the beginning of SL scenes.
- Implemented a grass FPS fix although it may lead to less variability in grass cover density.
- Fixed an issue where footsteps could be heard while jumping.

### 1.1.2

Corrected all those damn Males of Skyrim again and spawned them all to make sure they looked good and talked to them all to make sure they didn't crash. The 2 Ulfrics shouting FusRoDah at the 2 Tulliuses made this difficult. Hopefully an ongoing Nemesis problem has been resolved as well.

### 1.1.1

Fixed a few BFBs from Males of Skyrim.

### 1.1

Corrections based on feedback from WJ's modlist testers.

### 1.0

Preparation for initial submission.

### 0.1.1

A lot of changes this time around due to problems that arose during my own testing. Please start reporting these on the issues tab, people! The main one was the installation of the standalone Creature Framework 1.1.02B to prevent certain... invisible equipment. Recommend you backup your saves before updating if you use LBK. Disabled Atlas Map Marker's overworld map to prevent fast travel that skips quest triggers. Activated several mods that should be deactivated by default, but must be active to ensure their installation by Wabbajack. Adjusted the footsteps to prevent doubling of certain sound effects. Converted a couple of plugins to Form 44 that I suspect caused crashes. Clarified options within the MCM to increase stability, compatibility, and user choice.

### 0.1.0.2

Hid the invalid script plugin leftover in MNC. This should cause no problems because the modder himself admitted he meant to remove it but forgot. Enabled the BodyGen3 folder from WJ NSFW so that it would properly download for the enduser. Changed breast physics to a more static variant to reflect possible usage of BodyGen. Disabled fast-travel to non-vanilla locations to prevent scripted event bugs. Finalized my ASLAL DCUR patch (hopefully) so there won't be any more damnable flickering in the slaver cave. Clarified instructions for BodySlide and FNIS/Nemesis in the README.

### 0.1.0.1

Downloaded and collected the metas for FNIS to ensure they would install properly for the enduser.

### 0.1

First release. The core of _Light But Sexy_ is intact, with a bunch of worldspace removals to prevent save bloat. Also, the universe's most-hated mod, _Combat Gameplay Overhaul_ is in for no other reason than I like playing with it. It's not Smashed or Mastered to anything so if you would prefer not to use it just disable it. The option is also here to use FNIS with Nemesis for creature animations and CGO, Nemesis or FNIS without CGO, as well as switching MO2 profiles to _Light But Kinky_ for Cursed Loot to resolve incompatibilities which cannot be accomplished in any other way.
