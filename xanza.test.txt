 Ensure that keywords are properly forwarded.
 EDIT: These are templated with the proper keywords.

 [] Skyrim Immersive Creatures

 Xanza, one thing to be aware of is that Skyrim Immersive Creatures changes the mesh for the White Stag, but does not include the mesh.
 So not only is the Stag invisible, it is impossible to select in console.
 You may wish to revert this mesh change.

 Et Al...
 
 It appears this sequence of Bandit entries is patched with a dagger from the Vampire list, but reverts to ITM USSEP's perk changes.
 
 [0F] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (25292C59) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 02003788 <DLC1AlthadanVyrthur>
 
 Vampire Loot Record is reverted.

 [0F] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (25292C59) \ Weapon \ 000AA1DC <EnchOrcishWarAxeMagicka03>
 
 UHHH, it looks like your final "patch" for these just reverts them to master.
 
 [0F] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (25292C59) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ Block 0, -1 \ Sub-Block 0, -3 \ 0000982A <HelgenExterior02> \ Temporary \ 0008C19A
 
 Encounter Zone from USSEP reverted by AP

 WTF... the pretty coloorrzzzzz I'm so high man...
 
ACT TWO: THE REST

 [10] Mountains Enhanced.esp (91DBD182) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ Block 0, -1 \ Sub-Block 1, -4
 [10] Mountains Enhanced.esp (91DBD182) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ Block 0, -1 \ Sub-Block 2, -4
 [10] Mountains Enhanced.esp (91DBD182) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ Block 1, -1 \ Sub-Block 5, -4
 
 Don't all of these Region keywords need to be forwarded? They appear to relate to Survival Mode.
 
 [FE 043] ClefJ's Fort Dawnguard.esp (F8F97B45) \ Worldspace \ 02001DB8 <DLC1HunterHQWorld> \ Block 0, -1 \ Sub-Block 0, -1 \ 02001DD3 <DLC1DawnguardGate3>

 Weather probably needs to be forwarded.
 
 [1C] Weapons Armor Clothing & Clutter Fixes.esp (0E8D8091) \ Armor \ 000C5D10 <ClothesWarlockHoodUnplayable>
 
 There is a error in the Armature record.
 
 [1C] Weapons Armor Clothing & Clutter Fixes.esp (0E8D8091)
 
 Not a big deal I guess, but sometimes these ARMO and WEAP records take the name from
 WACCF and other times from Thaumaturgy. Is there a reason?
 
 [23] Thaumaturgy.esp (9BE8F50D) \ Weapon \ 000AA1DB <MAG_EnchOrcishWarAxeMagickaDamage02>
 [23] Thaumaturgy.esp (9BE8F50D) \ Weapon \ 000AA1DC <MAG_EnchOrcishWarAxeMagickaDamage03>
 
 Both of these appear to be just straight up reverted to master.
 
 [FE 0B3] DumplingsbyKadraeus.esp (21D166B6)
 [FE 0B4] homeymealyum.esp (9694001E)
 
 Nice touch. :)
 
 [5A] SunHelmSurvival.esp (888C54D6) \ Water \ 00000018 <DefaultWater>
 
 Maybe the `Causes Damage` flag needs to be forwarded here? Or are you only using
 Sunhelm for Diseases and Survival Mode for Needs?
 
 I'll admit I am mystified by a lot of your smaller cell and worldspace patches, the JK's / Lux ones especially.
  Either they have small vertex position changes that don't show up in xEdit normally,
  Or they appear to be completely identical to their masters -- no records changed at all.
  Maybe you could enlighten me?
  Did you create these in CK?
  
THE END
