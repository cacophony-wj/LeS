# CACO'S COMPREHENSIVE MOD GUIDE

## For Mods Primarily in _Licentia 11_ (But Also In Other Lists)

**Please Note:** _Licentia 11_ is not presently available on _Wabbajack._ It is in development and will likely be so for some time, with staged rollouts beginning at the end of September. Try the test profile on September 24th, and opt into the **ELEVEN** role on the _Jolly-Co-Operators_ server to get pings about weekly updates!

"Adds hundreds of new artifacts, each with their own unique effects, appearance, and story. Some artifacts are easy to find, others are quite well hidden. Some are powerful, some are utterly useless!"

### Core Gameplay Mods

### Visual Mods

#### Texture Overhauls

- Skyland All-In-One
- Mrf's Markarth
- Illustrious Whiterun SE
- Riften of Reverie

Larger texture overhauls have been de-emphasized with _Licentia 11_ to allow for a broader spectrum of users. That said, most of the overhauls previously used are still in the list, so appearances at moderate resolutions will not be greatly compromised while vastly improving performance and reducing overall installation size. Essentially, a setup extremely similar to @Sparr's "performance profile" is now the primary focus of the list.

### Animation Mods

- FNIS - Fores New Idles in Skyrim **(REPLACED BY THE FOLLOWING)**
- Project New Reign - Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine

This is a straight up successor to _FNIS._ Anytime you read anything about _FNIS_, just substitute _Nemesis_ for it because that's what this mod does in its place. 

- Simple Dual Sheath

Twin blood drenched greatswords crossed across a hot comic book babe's backside. Nuff said.

### Major Core Mods

- SSE Engine Fixes

Basically makes the whole game be less crappy. Memory management is better, large modlists work better, crashes happen less often, fewer freezes and infinite load screens, an all around fantastic mod.

- SSE Display Tweaks

Does what Engine Fixes does for the visual output. If you change something like resolution or scaling or VSYNC in the INI's and it does nothing -- check this mod, often its values are overwriting the defaults. A truly fantastic piece of work.

- SSE Gameplay Tweaks
- powerofthree's Tweaks
- Scrambled Bugs
- Scrambled Eggchantments

Does what the previous two mods do for Skyrim's gameplay. 

**Please note, the above mods have config files with various extensions such as TXT, INI, and/or TOML. They are all preferably opened with Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code, both free apps. Remember that configuring the above mods on your own violates _Rule 11_ and should only be discussed in the modification-friendly support areas for your chosen modlist.**

- Spell Perk Item Distributor

An astonishing mod that can add stuff to NPCs like spells, perks, or items with a simple line item entry. 

### Minor Core Mods

- MCM Recorder

Included mostly for convenience to my users. If you have a certain set of MCM options you want to make every new game, you can record them with this mod. 

- No Silly Physics Damage

Notice how you don't die walking through piles of bones anymore? Yeah, this mod fixes that stupid bug.

- JContainers

I don't really know what this is or why it's so great but **EggyPapa** the Papyrus guy says its the best thing since sliced bread.
