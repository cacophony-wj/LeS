##  Female Bodies And Outfits

I'm guessing you came here to appreciate the female form. Here in the Skyrim community we use an application called _BodySlide_ for that.

### Running BodySlide

I have included _many_ 3BA presets. Some of them, especially the "Legendary" series, are extremely lore friendly.

But you can always install your own.

You will also have to follow all of the steps below.

1. Launch _BodySlide x64_ from the _Executables_ menu on the right, the one with the **Run** button. 
3. You **may** receive a warning that you do not have "write access to the game data directory." This warning cannot be prevented as everyone uses different hard drives and different install directories. Follow the steps below and it will correct itself. **If you do not get this error** it means that there is a Skyrim data folder in the same directory as mine and you need to _make sure_ it is the correct one, so follow the directions below anyway.
4. Click the _Settings_ button in the lower right corner of _BodySlide_.	
5. Click _Browse_ next to _Game Data Path_.	
6. Navigate to your **Data** directory within your **Skyrim Special Edition** directory.
7. Click _Select Folder_
8. Click **OK**
9. Click the _Group Filter_ magnifying glass (upper right). 
10. Click _Choose Groups..._
11. Place a checkmark next to the _3BA_ group and _Unassigned_ group.
13. Click _OK_
14. In the top left dropdown, select _CBBE 3BBB Body Amazing_
15. Select your preset from the dropdown below that. 
16. Preview it with the appropriate button.
17. (I recommend _3BBB HangEmHigh_. My friend Bill spent a lot of time on it, I had it in mind when I configured the physics, and you can use _Body Size_ at character creation to change what you look like by quite a bit, without messing around with dozens of _CBBE Morphs_.)
18. Once you are satisfied, ensure that the checkbox _Build Morphs_ next to the _Batch Build_ button in the lower left is **enabled**.	
19. **Hold down the CTRL key** (very important) and click _Batch Build_. 
20. You will see a huge list of bodies and outfits. Just click _Build_.
21. A prompt will appear asking where to put your custom-fitted outfits. Make sure they go to **_Licentia Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**.
22. **Do not put your outfits anywhere but _BodySlide Output_.**
23. Click _Select Folder_
25. Click OK
26. Wait for your outfits to be built in the popup labeled **Processing Outfits**.
27. You should receive the message "All outfits processed successfully!"
28. Click OK
29. If you receive any error messages, repeat the process from the Batch Build step until you receive the above message.
30. When finished, navigate to **_Licentia Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output/meshes** and make sure a little over a dozen or so outfits folders are there.
31. If there is only a _meshes_ folder there, move it to **_Licentia Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output**
32. **Confirm that all the outfits folders are in _Licentia Directory_/mods/BodySlide Output/meshes. They should not be located anywhere else.**
33. You may continue.

### Changing It Up

If you get bored with the female body you have in your game just come back to this portion of the readme and follow all the instructions with a different preset. Nothing will be harmed, your save won't be affected, it's just everybody will fit the new body.

### Adjusting Physics

A key part of fun with boobs is adjusting how they bounce. This modlist ships with a conservative physics preset which might not be "energetic" enough if you prefer massive mound-like mammaries. If you make a dramatic change in boob size you want to change the physics to match. Don't worry, nothing will break your game or your save unless you change something I explicitly tell you not to.

1. Right click on _CBBE 3BA (3BBB)_ and choose _Reinstall_
2. **DO NOT** choose any options in the first menu. They will break this list. Just click _Next_
3. It's impossible to change _Base CBPC._ Check _Performance (Improved)_ and click _Next_
4. Choose _Full SMP_ and click _Next_
5. Now for the "fallback" _CBPC_ options. Choose _New Type_ and click _Next_
7. If your body has small boobs when thin and big boobs when heavy (you can check this with the slider in the preview window of _BodySlide_), it's best to choose _Real Bounce_ and _Small~Big Boobs_. Otherwise, choose the options that best match _your_ boobs.
8. Belly, butt, and legs are like Zoidberg on higher than _Muscular_. But it might turn you on to be a walking bowl of JELL-O so I leave it to you.
10. Next is _SMP_ that you manually turn on with _F12_. These physics look extremely sexy but will cripple your PC if used too liberally. I recommend only activing them before an adult scene.
11. _Boobs Physics Preset_ you're just gonna have to take a stab at.
12. You **MUST** choose _CBPC - RegularSOS_. The other two options are incompatible.
13. Hoo boy. _Vagina Textures_. Personally I think anything but "Dark Red" seems to be so bright it glows. But you can try it.
14. Ensure that on this screen, only _Replace CBBE v1.6.x Morph Sliders_ is checked.
15. Click _Install_, followed by _Replace_, and wait for the mod's progress bar to go away.
16. That's it. Hop in game and try out your new funbags.
