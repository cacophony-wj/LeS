## Servitium Configuration

## A Note About Creation Club Survival

I have intentionally left disabled most of the "Needs" functions of _SexLab Survival_ which, admittedly, is one of the primary goals of the mod, because I find hypothermia, camping, campfires, food, drink, sleep, and bathing too tedious to manage and still play the game. This is still supposed to be mostly Skyrim... just a Skyrim from a porn movie. Instead, I have found myself struck with the simplicity of _Skyrim Survival_ as it is available on the _Creation Club._ I think it covers the "gist" of keeping your body alive in the frozen wastes without burying you in micromanagement.

The way it works is by a system of debuffs to your health, stamina, and magicka based on how cold, hungry or tired you are. Small black portions appear on the bars to tell you how much you are affected, similar to the red "rads" portion of the _Fallout 4_ health bar. In addition, the more you are affected, the more magicka, stamina, health regeneration are affected, as well as the effectiveness of certain skills like potions and weapon speed. It provides an intuitive, at-a-glance way to manage needs and works well to offset the OP nature of CGO and EnaiRim, as well as interacting with the next major new system, _SexLab Separate Orgasms._

## A note about SexLab Separate Orgasms

The way this mod works by turning sex into a little "minigame." By default, you press the "X" key on your controller to increase your partner's enjoyment (and your own), however, this drains a little stamina. When it goes all the way down, the scene advances. If you go too long without pressing "X", your partner's enjoyment will go down a little. Your goal is to max out their enjoyment before the scene ends, which you can take any number of potions, alcoholic drinks, or other buffs to help along. Don't worry, it's set to very forgiving by default and you should only have trouble if you are suffering severe debuffs from the Survival mod mentioned above. In addition, sometimes your partner will try to "spank" you, where you have to please him (or her) or talk dirty (by pressing "Y") to keep him from spanking you and penalizing your stamina further. Basically it makes every SexLab scene into a little porn movie. Kinda sick, I guess, but I didn't decide how the world makes its porn. I just installed mods around it. If you want to use a Mouse and Keyboard you WILL need to change these keys yourself, the relevant options are in the "SL Separate Orgasms" menu for the enjoyment key and the "Spank That Ass" menu for the "Talk Dirty" key. I recommend M1 for Enjoyment and M2 for talk dirty.

## Buying Skyrim Survival

So you've decided to take the plunge and try this. I fully admit that its overpriced and the method buying it is extremely dumb. You have to sign in to vanilla, unmodded Skyrim (launch from Steam) and click the "Creation Club" link. It should automatically detect and use your Steam payment information, and you will have to buy 249 credits more than the 500 you need for Survival Mode. If you choose to do this, and spend those 249 credits on something else, I will ensure it is compatible. 

Trust me, if there were a simpler option than Frostfall available that worked basically the same way for no cost I would include it. You can always play this modlist without Survival Mode. And if you know of an alternative, please hit me up on my server and tell me about it.

## Setting your resolution

_Servitium_ should default to your monitor's native resolution on installation. This _will not_ be 60FPS at 4k and most likely not at 1440p. If you care more about FPS than resolution, or wish to use your own ENB, you may wish to dial the resolution back a bit. To do so, click the hammer and gear icon and choose _INI Editor_. Now search the _SkyrimCustom.ini_ for a line that begins with _iSize_. (Should be under [Display] which is itself in alphabetical order.) Change the values for _iSize H_ and _iSize W_ to the resolution you wish. Below are some common resolutions you can use.

"1080p" is _iSize H = 1080_ & _iSize W = 1920_
"1440p" is _iSize H = 1440_ & _iSize W = 2560_
"2160p" or "True 4K" is _iSize H = 2160_ & _iSize W = 3840_

If you have an Ultrawide monitor, you will need [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1778). Install it as you would any other Mod Organizer mod. Just put it under _Added Mods._

I can't help you get it working or test problems with it because I don't have Ultrawide. You can always refer to other Wabbajack readmes or drop by Discord and type _!usesearch_ to hunt for other users' experiences.

## Click New Game

You might wonder why I put something so obvious here but you'd be surprised at the questions I get. It takes longer to load Skyrim with all these textures, and if you're not on an SSD you're probably going to have a bad time.

## Character Creation

Creating a face is very time consuming so I have included many presets. Use your mouse to click the _Presets_ button in the upper right, choose _Load Preset_, and experiment with the options. Make sure your race matches the race of the preset (A - Altmer, Bo - Bosmer, Br - Breton, D - Dunmer, I - Imperial, N - Nord, O - Orsimer, R - Redguard).  There are no presets for Argonians and Khajiits for some reason. I made two male presets, a mage and a warrior, with an (M) after the name. Keep in mind that if you choose a _male elf_ character, the facial hair will look weird unless you switch the _Face Part_ to **3.** You'll know you have the right one when it says "high poly" in the bottom right and the face suddenly looks 10,000 times more detailed. Tweak to your liking, you might enjoy some of the _KS SMP_ hairs in the rightward section of the _Hairs_ slider, they have physics which probably won't work until character creation is complete. You can also tweak your body a bit with the _CBBE Morphs_ and _Genitals_ options, but I am not going to go into that. Don't ask me either. Experiment and figure it out. One thing you can do is open the console with the _Tilde `_ key, click on yourself, and type _unequipall_, and then reload your preset to go nude. Click _Done_ (in the lower left) when you are finished.

**IF YOUR BODY TURNS PURPLE**, scroll Racemenu over to _Body Paint_ and make sure all Textures are set to _Default_ (press the "T" key)

## AS SOON AS CHARACTER CREATION IS COMPLETE

You will get a **POPUP** from "The Curators Companion". Answer Ok and **DO NOTHING** until you get another popup. Click _Scan Later_. After a third popup, you should be ready to continue.

## A bit of a note on System Settings

### Controls

The controls for "Servitium" are specifically designed for use with a controller. Please be certain to **delete** any _ControlMap_Custom_ files in your Skryim **game* directory if you plan to do so. Note that you will have to bind any keyboard controls again (such as QuickSave / QuickLoad)

If you want to use a mouse and keyboard, close Skryim and disable everything under the _Controller_ section in the left pane. 

Unfortunately 8-way dodges are not possible with a controller without an external program and forcing "always run" which is essential to any type of Sneak. As you play, keep in mind that you can roll or step dodge in only the four cardinal directions. Sneak / Dodge is on "B" (Like Dark Souls). You can switch between the step dodge and a roll with the G key. The menu is weird, "Start" opens the system and quest menu "RB + Start" opens the "TweeN" menu (skills / magic / items / map). Lock on is set to "LB." _CGO_ and _TUDM_ are NOT presently set up, you'll have to fix them the way you want as per the instructions below.

**Under the System > Settings Menu** change Quicksave_ to _F9_, and _Quickload_ to _F10_. Don't worry about using them because _Engine Fixes_ converts them to full saves. However, and I realize this is a pain, _do not_ use the "QuickSave" option from the System menu! Bad things can (and probably will) happen to your long-term save. In addition _do not_ turn on any "Autosave" options. They can and will corrupt with time. Get used to saving a lot!

I'm oldschool so sometimes I play with an inverted controller. If your controls are inverted you might have to change it since I forgot to.

## CONTROLLER MAPPING

Start: Journal
Back: Wait
LT: Left Attack
RT: Right attack
LB+Back: Quicksave
RB+Start: Tween menu (character menu)
LB+RB: Shout (in that order)
LB: Lock-on (activate / deactivate)
RB: Sprint
LS: Favorites
RS: Switch POV
A: Activate
B: Sneak (when still) / Roll (when moving)
X: Ready weapon
Y: Jump

## Game MCM Options

**NOTE:** Any menus or options not specifically mentioned here can be ignored.

It is _very important_ to **wait** until _all_ messages have both ceased appearing and disappearing in the upper left corner of the screen before continuing.

### SexLab

#### Install

Under **SexLab 1.63 SE dev beta 8 by Ashal@LoversLab.com**

Click _INSTALL/UPDATE SEXLAB 163 SE DEV BETA 8_

Close the menu and wait. Once again, a series of messages will appear in the upper left corner. 

Do not touch the mouse or keyboard until the following message appears:

**SexLab - SexLab v1.63 SE dev beta 8 - Ready!**

Then open the MCM and continue.

### SexLab

#### Sex Diary / Journal

Your character is considered heterosexual by default. If you wish to change this, under **Sexual stats** on the right, click _Sexuality_ until your preference (Bisexual, Gay, or Lesbian) appears.

####  Rebuild & Clean

Just below **Debug / Development Mode** in the upper right corner, click _Import Settings: Click Here_

A message will appear which concludes with "Do you want to continue?" Click _Accept_

Another message will appear, "SexLab configuration successfully imported." Click _Accept_

I have removed all Futa options because I am not into them. _Strap-ons are enabled_ however, because the mods in _Servitium_ sometimes put females in a male role for group animations. You can disable them if you want, but you'll mostly likely get dickless humping animations anyway. _Too bad!_

Note that **ALL** of _SexLab's_ original old animations have been suppressed due to unpopularity. If you want to re-enable them for some reason, click _CLEAR SUPPRESSED LIST - CLICK HERE_

### SexLab

### SAVE AND LOAD!

Lover's Lab recommends saving and loading the game immediately after fully configuring SexLab. Please do so now. If the QuickSave and QuickLoad buttons have changed, recall that they are now _F9_ and _F10_.

###  SL Anim Loader

#### General Options

Click _Enable All: Click Here_

Click _General_, again on the left. Click _Register Animations_

The process will take about five minutes, whereupon you will receive a message that animations have been registered. Just click _Accept_

### A Matter of Time

Load the User Preset.

###  Cathedral Weathers

Click _Seasonal Perspective_

###  CGO

#### Settings

These will be vastly different depending on whether you use KB+M or controller.

**Unlocked Grip**

_Hotkey_: For KB, I recommend _Z_. For controller, I recommend _D-Pad Right_.

I recommend unchecking _NPCs Change Grip_ as it conflicts with the Follower mod.

**Dual Wield Blocking** 

For mouse, I recommend the _scroll wheel button._ For controller, I recommend _LB_ or _L1_.

**Unlocked Movement**

I recommend unchecking all of these due to various bugs.

**Dodge Roll**

Set to _Input Type: Hotkey_ because we will be dodging with TUDM. Uncheck all three options below.

**Leaning**

Set _1st Person_ to _0.00_ to prevent motion sickness.

**Camera Noise**

Set to _0.00_ to prevent motion sickness.

**360 Combat**

_Not supported._ Do _NOT_ enable this option.


### Clockwork

3 hours is bullshit. You'll never stop fighting those fuckers. Set it to 6.

### Diverse Dragons Col. 3

### Creature Framework

#### Performance

Minimize it all. Set _Cloak range_ to _1000_, _max creatures_ to _4_ and _cooldown_ to _120 seconds_.

### Deadly Dragons

#### Special

Uncheck _Knockdown_ unless you like to ragequit.

### Diverse Dragons Col. 3

#### Dragons

Disable _Nether Dragon_, _Sanguine Dragon_, and _Vile Dragon._ These are so difficult they are almost invincible, and decidedly un-fun.

### Extended UI

Check _Hide Legendary UI Elements_, _Show Attribute Modifiers_ and _Show Skill Modifiers._ Legendary skills are kinda pointless because True Dragonborn makes the skill cap like 667 or some shit.

### FEC

All this is kinda how flashy you want people to die. AT the bare minimum, I find _Fire Damage_ and _Shock Damage_, under the relevant sections, to be extremely annoying. Basically, bodies can't be touched after they've been burned or electrocuted to death or you will take damage. Turn that shit off.

###  Follower Framework

####  System

In the upper right, click _Load From File - CLICK HERE_

At the message **Settings Loaded. Please exist the MCM menu to apply all changes.** click _Ok_

Exit the MCM and re-open it.

### GIST Soul Trap

Check _Show messages on soul trapped_

### Growl Werebeasts

Check _Invulnerable During Transformation_

### Quick Light

Set _Type of Light Source_ to _No Special Effect._

Set _Brightness_ to _Wide_

Set the light key to your preference, but I recommend _NUMPAD 1_ because it doesn't conflict with anything imporant.

### Sacrosanct Vampires

Check _Fortitude: Disable_

### Schlongs of Skyrim

If you kinda hate seeing tiny wangs, set the _Min schlong size_ to 7. If you kinda love tiny wangs, leave it alone.

### Serio's Hotkeys

Recommend _Use Vanilla Hotkeys_ if you're on controller.

You'll have to read about the mod if you wanna use it, I don't mess with it really.

### SexLab Adventures

Choose _Load from file_, pick the one labeled _Adventures_, and hit _Exit._ 

You'll need to go to _Proximity_ and turn off _Attempt when Undressing_ because this option refuses to export for some reason. 

**LOVER'S LAB!**

###  SexLab Aroused

#### Settings

_General_

Check _Purge Dead Actors Every 10 Game Days_

Check _Enable SOS_.

###  SexLab Eager NPCs

####  General

Decide if you want a lot of automatic prompts for sex or a few.

If you want a few, click _Enable and Load Defaults - (CLICK)_.

If you want a lot, click _Enable and load profile - (CLICK)_. 

Upon receiving the message **Profile loaded successfully!** click _OK_ and close the MCM.

This mod takes a bit to activate. 

Wait for this message to appear in the upper left: **Masturbate (SLEN) added**.

###  SexLab Solutions

#### Animations

If you find foreplay kinda boring turn it off. If it turns you on, leave it on. It will probably suck with SLSO.

####  follower

Choose the appropriate options here to offer a follower instead of yourself for sexual favors. This is mainly useful if you aren't attracted to a particular sex.

### Miscellaneous

Enable _SLEN Integration_

### SexLab Tools

#### Settings

_Matchmaker queue_

**Matchmaker queue key**: set to _NUMPAD 2_

Ignore the message that the key is already mapped and answer "Yes."

**Please Note**: You can hover your crosshair over any person and press _NUMPAD 2_ to set up a sex scene at any time with any animation without any consequences. Please note that the person in the _receiver_ slot is always the "bottom" in a sex scene. Every other slot is an _actor_ and will primarily have sex with the receiver although sometimes it varies. 

To add yourself to a slot, hover your crosshair over empty space and press _NUMPAD 2_. Then select the slot you want to participate in. Each time you place somebody in a slot, you will have to choose several options. _Set with animation_ obviously, then the type of animation you want. 

Finally you'll have to type in how many total people will be in the scene. And yes, you have to do this _every time you add somebody_. It's not the best. 

Here's what makes up for it though, after you begin the scene by clicking on empty space and choosing _Begin scene_, you can press the _Shift+H_ keys to select from a list of commands, including changing positions, stages, and choosing animations from a list. Remember, it only draws from the first 250, or the first 250 of whatever tag you set. If your tag is too specific, nothing will be in the list.

### Sky UI

#### General

**Active Effects HUD**

Disable it

#### Advanced

Disable _Map Menu checking_

### SmoothCam

#### Presets

Click on _Slot 1: Perfect_ under _Load Preset_ and wait for the message.

### SL Survival

I forgot to add the hugest section!

This mod is extremely bloated. In setting it up, I got frustrated so many times I almost considered removing it despite all the crazy features it adds. It shares this in common with _Cursed Loot_, another mod that's too bloated in my opinion. Unlike Cursed Loot, however, it seems this mod (aside from the _MCM_) works properly once you understand how you're supposed to use it.

I'll save the gameplay talk for the channel. For now, you are going to have to _Import Profile_ on the main page. _Wait until all the messages cycle_ and hang up at "Actioning Settings." It's not supposed to hang here but it does. Exit all menus.

Now this part is very picky. Sit and **do nothing** in the starting cell until you receive two messages: "Building Bikini List", and a minute or two later "Building Bikini List Complete." 

Now you're going to have to give it a little kick for it to finish. Open the _MCM_ again and return to the _SL Survival Menu_. Once you see the main page of settings, exit the MCM again, and wait for two messages: "Building Pickpocket List" and a few minutes later "Pickpocket List Complete."

There. _SL Survival_ is now configured and all executing scripts are complete.

This will also help you on your _Dungeons & Deviousness_ installation if you still have one.

Now,

### The Ultimate Dodge Mod

#### General Settings

_Combat Dodging Style_ recommend _Roll Only_

Enable _Lock Default Dodging Style_

#### Player Settings

Enable _Gamepad Compatibility_

Set to _Sneak Style 2_

#### NPC Settings

Uncheck _NPC Dodge AI_. My followers have been known to get stuck in midair with this option enabled.

### VioLens

#### Profile System

Just check _Killmove Invulnerability_ to prevent crashes.

Disable _Ranged Killmoves_ so you can hit things.

### Defeat

Aww shit. Here we go again. Save before you do this in case something goes wrong.

Enable it.

Close the menu.

Wait for the message.

Import the profile.

Pray to mighty Cthulhu that it works.

## All done!

Be sure to make a last second save in case something bad happens. You _do not_ want to do these MCMs again. There are two options to start your game. The first is to talk to the Mara statue for a more traditional method. Sexy starts (most of the time involving you being naked) are available from the bookshelf nearby.
