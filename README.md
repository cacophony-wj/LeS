**All Hail ForgottenGlory for the above image!**

_If you are into an utterly degenerate vision of Skyrim focused on sheer sexual pain and suffering, or you want to experience the ultimate that Lover's Lab has to offer via its "SexLab" framework, this is not the modlist for you. Instead,I recommend "Dungeons & Deviousness" for the ultimate hardcore experience, or "Atelier" for the ultimate screenshot experience! And hell, why not give "Living Skyrim 3" a run as well?! You can find them here:_

https://www.fgsmodlists.com/home

# Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

I'm [cacophony](https://github.com/cacophony-wj), a humble person. Perhaps the _most_ humble person _ever_. (That goes along with the territory as the universe's giantest nerd.) Welcome to the latest incarnation of _Licentia_ which I have dubbed "All Good Things." This modlist has been completely revamped to completely remove the save-unfriendly _SexLab_ framework to emphasize the far more low-key _NSFW_ framework known as _OStim_ by _Sairion_ which in turn is based on one of Skyrim's first sex frameworks, _OSex_ by _Ceo_, which has been long abandoned. It is still intended primarily as a high fantasy "Game of Thrones" Skyrim -- ultimate power fantasy via the _Enairim_ collection of mods jumped up on steroids with _Vokriinator Black_ and _DServant's Archery_ and _Combat Gameplay Overhauls._ However, now it includes the ability to create your own family throughout Skyrim via the use of _Fertility Mode_ patched for _OStim_ and soon to be expanded via the _ORomance_ mod, all while indulging in life's guilty pleasures - wine, chocolate, cheese... and trading card games!

_In addition_ I offer full support for _every mod from Creation Club,_ available from the dropdown menu with the option "Licentia - Full CC". You can also use just the _Survival_ bundle with "Licentia - Survival". Both modes offer a lot of variety! I recommend you move the _cc* esls_ and _bsas_ appearing in your Data folder to the "CC" mods inside the "Mods" folder. This way they will not interfere with any other _Wabbajack_ modlists. _To activate Survival Mode_ you will have to find your way to an outdoor area or just past _Helgen Keep_ (if you are playing the vanilla intro). A popup will appear. _Be warned,_ fast travel will be enabled and I _do not_ use any carriage overhauls, make up for it by practicing your archery on the hundreds of extra added animals and build your kill XP as you wander around.

A note about difficulty, _AGO,_ _CGO_ and especially _Vokriinator Black_ are impossible to balance for. Nobody at Wabbajack has any idea how to do it (I've asked the pros) because these mods dramatically increase the power of the PC to such an overwhelming level that you _will_ become unstoppably godlike at some point. I personally get a kick out of this because I am a filthy casual who dies at every bandit sneeze. If you want a playthrough that is challenging from beginning to end, you should probably look into something like _Elysium_ or _Living Skyrim_ at the midrange or the Requiem list _Serenity_ at the top end of difficulty. As it is though, there are a few things you can do. First is to just straight up turn up the main difficulty, it defaults to _Adept_ which is very easy, even for a solo player. _Wildcat_ alters the damage values dramatically so you take more damage at higher levels and deal less. Next, play around with the options in the _Wildcat_ mod. You can enable _Dynamic Combat_ and _Injuries_ for a lot of punishing options (although arrow fatigue is incompatible with AGO). Full body stagger is a real killer but makes melee almost impossible. Lastly, adjust the values in the _Deadly Dragons_ mod (you can turn the difficulty all the way up to "Insane" and enable Knockdown for a true table-flipping experience), _OBIS SE_ (turn up the number of extra bandits super high and enable the alternate spawns such as minotaurs and spiders), and _Extended Encounters_ (enable the "Swarm" options as well as "Factions Hunt Player.") This will not last forever, by the time you are stacking Vokriinator perks at level 50 or so even the gods will quail before you. But you can at least delay the game's insignificance, and adjust on-the-fly as well depending on how hard a time you are having. Don't feel bad! This modlist is about having fun and making your own sexy Dragonborn story -- not anything as high-falutin' as the purity of gameplay. 

A note about save scumming, a peril for any modlist but especially script-heavy ones such as _Licentia AGT_. If you spend 30 minutes reloading after death again and again, especially during or after combat, a _lot_ of stuff will break on your save. I recently had it happen myself when I tested the first Dragon on _Deadly Dragons'_ "Expert" difficulty -- my Curator's Companion stopped registering new items and could not be reset. If you can't get past a group of enemies without repeated deaths and reloads, consider accepting your limitations and retreating, or dialing the difficulty back a notch or two. (Nobody is going to give you a trophy for your Ironman NSFW Skyrim playthrough.) If you continue to save and load rapidly, complete corruption of your save can result. This includes symptoms such as being unable to wield weapons, die, or even load the game. 

A word about ENBs. This list was designed with the intention of following Rudy's _Cathedral Weathers ENB_ weather and lighting recommendations. However, several other fantastic options include _PI CHO KONAN_, _Serio's ENB_, _LJoss_, and _PI-CHO Standard_. If you are running this modlist at 4k, I _strongly_ recommend switching the ENB to _Serio's_. Don't limit yourself to my choices, though, in theory, any _ENB_ that works with _Cathedral Weathers_ will work here, including the popular _Silent Horizons_. Choose carefully, ENBs are the most demanding part of any modlist. 

# A STRONG WARNING

Before asking a question, look at [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Many common questions are answered there.

## Requirements

- [Nexus Premium Account](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/store/category/1-premium-membership/)
- [LoversLab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)

### System Specs

This portion is under review, but my best estimate as to what you need is as follows:

- CPU: >= 7th gen Intel processor OR >= AMD Ryzen 3000 series processor
- GPU: >= 1080, you need at least 6GB of VRAM
- RAM: >= DDR4 with at least 12GBs

Everything should be installed on an SSD that has at least 250GB of space available. 

Please note that you will also require _at least_ an additional 30GB on the drive you installed Wabbajack.exe to for extraction and recompression of files.

## Installation

##  Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to **Updating**  in the **Troubleshooting** section.

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from Microsoft. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Direct link</a> if you can't find it.

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically update the game for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), head over to the Properties window, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_ while you're at it.

**Set the Game language to English**

Wabbajack will check your game files and make sure that we have the same version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab and select English from the dropdown menu.

**Install Skyrim** (OPTIONAL)

If Skyrim is not installed, do so. _DO NOT_ install it _ANYWHERE_ inside a _Program Files_ folder. This will only wreak havoc in the end. 

If you must, create a Steam library elsewhere on your computer (for example, _D:\Steam_) and install Skyrim there. (Options for such are given within Steam.)

If you only have one hard drive and Steam is installed to _C:\Program Files_, you will have to relocate it to _C:\_. I'm sorry.

**Clean Skyrim**

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. **Do not install Skyrim anywhere inside any Program Files folder. Wabbajack will not work in a folder that is protected by Windows.** You should also clean up the Skyrim Special Edition folder in Documents/My Games/. 

**Start Skyrim**

After you have done everything above and have a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the Options menu.

    Click on Ultra
    Set the Aspect Ratio and Resolution to your monitor's native values
    Set Antialiasing to Off
    Uncheck Windowed Mode and Borderless

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

##  Using Wabbajack

##  Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD. You will also need an additional 30 GB beyond the modlists' official size to store temporary working files. It is not recommended to allow your drive to get over 90% full (red bar in File Explorer) so be sure to leave yourself a little headroom on top of all that.

    Adjust the Installation Location to a directory located on the root directory of one of your drives
    For example, this might be "C:\Licentia", "D:\Licentia", or "E:\Licentia"
    Ensure the Download Location is within that directory
    Click the Go/Begin button
    Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

**DO NOT CONTACT MOD AUTHORS DIRECTLY.**

I, cacophony, fully accept any responsibility for difficulties with this list and any conflicts I introduce, so please do not question mod authors on the _Nexus_, _Lover's Lab_, _Vector Plexus_ or any other site about bugs that may result from this lists' use. Direct your questions to me, not the innocent mod authors who should never be expected to support a modlist setup.

**Could not download x:**

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till the modlist receives an update.

**x is not a whitelisted download:**

This can happen when update the modlist receives an update. Check if a new update to the modlist is available and wait if there is none.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the Pre-Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. DO NOT ASK FOR HELP WITH PIRATED GAMES ON THE WABBAJACK DISCORD.

**All downloads from Lover's Lab are failing.**

Lover's Lab is much more restrictive about automated downloads to users outside of the United States. Attempt to use a free- or budget- VPN with a terminus in the United States to automate your downloads. I personally recommend Proton VPN from _MIT_, it's free, has decent performance and maintains excellent privacy protections. If you do not have such an option, you will need to download the LL mods manually, as per the manifest section below.

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple Wabbajack lists. Sometimes it does anyway. Try signing up for a MEGA account, or if you have already done so, try logging out of it and downloading anonymously (although much more slowly). I can't tell you to do it, but a VPN _has been known_ to circumvent some of **MEGA**'s restrictions.

**Downloading from the Manifest**

Sometimes no matter what anyone tries, a file will not download from Wabbajack for some reason. If that happens to you, go to the _www.wabbajack.org_ website, find the gallery entry for _Licentia_, click _Archive Search_ and type _the filename_ of each mod you cannot download automatically. They can be downloaded from the _link_ icon (looks like a chain link). Ensure that any files you download go to your _Licentia_ downloads directory. Just save them there, do _not_ open them and definitely do _not_ extract them. Close Wabbajack, reopen it, and click the **PLAY** button again.

**Wabbajack cannot continue because of unknown files.**

Move your downloads folder outside of your _Licentia Directory_, ensure the _Licentia Directory_ is clear of all files, then close and restart Wabbajack. Be sure to point the downloads box to your relocated downloads folder.

## Post-Installation

**Copy Game Folder Files**

Download the latest ENB Series from [here](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm) and extract _only_ d3d11.dll and d3dcompiler_46e.dll from the _WrapperVersion_ folder to your game folder. This is the directory in which _SkyrimSE.exe_ is located.

Copy all of the files located inside the _Licentia Directory/game folder files_ directory to your game folder.

![COPY THESE FILES](gff.png "Game Folder Files")

Please note, **do not copy the entire game folder files folder.** Only copy the files _inside_ that folder to _Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim Special Edition_. There should be fewer than a dozen of them, as well as a folder entitled "enbseries".

## Preparing the Game

The next step is to prepare the game for play. Navigate to the directory where you installed the modlist _Licentia_. Inside you will notice an executable file called _ModOrganizer.exe_. This file (the _Mod Organizer 2_ application) has already been automatically installed and configured by Wabbajack with all the necessary mods to run the modlist and does not need to be updated, replaced, or manually configured. Simply launch it to continue.

## Crafting the Female Bodies

Unfortunately I don't feel comfortable offering precompiled BodySlide outputs because this essentially rehosts all of a 3D modelers' work in another location. So you will have to build them yourself. Please don't abandon me here, I've minimized the steps as much as possible. It's just a few clicks and a few extra seconds.

## Launching the Game

The rest must be completed after the game itself is launched. I recommend bringing up this readme on a portable device by navigating to [www.wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org) and referring to the Gallery. Anyway, Launch the modlist from the command which reads **SKSE**. If you receive a message that files are missing, do not exist, or a warning about an incorrect path, you _may_ have to edit the link to "skse_loader" in the drop down and point it to your Skyrim directory. Once you are in-game, create your character and follow _all_ of the instructions in the below link:

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Licentia_ folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.

## Contact

I am regularly available on the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) (`#nsfw-mod-discussion`) (`#licentia-support`). I will not respond to direct messages unless I know you. **DO NOT DIRECT MESSAGE ME**

If you enjoyed playing this modlist and feel that your time spent with it was worth any amount of money, consider donating to me in any amount of one dollar or more via my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cacophony1979). Your donation will better the quality of my life and ensure that I can spend more time improving _Licentia AGT._ There are no expectations for a recurring subscription, donate one dollar and immediately cancel if you wish. You will also receive benefits such as access to my Discord server's VIP channel where my friends and Wabbajack staff talk shop, as well as votes and mod suggestions to change the direction of _Licentia AGT_ in the future. Finally, a portion of all proceeds will be forwarded as donations to various signature modders featured in _Licentia AGT_, given that it could not exist without them.
