# Licentia et Servitium: A Modest Sampling of Lover's Lab

## BEFORE YOU CONTINUE: 

The current list on _Wabbajack_ is up to date. It is duplicated as **4.1** here in _releases_ **->**

**Minor fixes** have been posted in the support channel. Check the pins once you get in there (small thumbtack icon)

## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

I'm [cacophony](https://github.com/cacophony-wj), a humble person. I haven't been modding long, but I want to provide a modlist until a bigger NSFW one is made.

I also want to make a list with a lot of options.

Finally I want a list for the casual gamer who maybe wants to indulge in a little heroic fantasy.

That said, I have been putting _NSFW_ content into games since the first _Nude Raider_ patch so I am familiar with it. 

While not as customized as TSO, as feature-rich as Living Skyrim, or as depraved as Lotus, if you want a basic Skyrim gameplay and sexual overhaul that offers many ways to have fun, you are welcome. And of course, there's CGO, LOTD, and Maids.

## A STRONG WARNING

## SexLab SE is still **beta!** It is still buggy!

Before posting a question to Discord, look at [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Many common questions are answered there.

# Number One Rule: This List Is Customizable

Your kinks are a very private thing. I have included two profiles for different types of play. "Licentia et Servitium" (despite the name) includes only free-love options -- no fetish content (assuming you disable the strapons). "Servitium" has all the fetish content, including non-consensual, bondage and creatures. These two setups represent the most popular options for _Lover's Lab._ A brief warning, though, _Servitium_ will only work for a female character. That's just the way the cookie crumbles.

# Misaligned Animations

I have pared back the animations drastically on advice from others. It only introduces lag into SexLab, most of the animations are low quality, few of them are regularly updated, and after testing them extensively it seems only a limited selection of them ever see play. If you want more you will have to disover how to run _FNIS_ or _Nemesis_ for yourself because I will not support it. I will say that it's a lot easier using only one of them rather than both.

#  Admiring Yourself

For those who want to experience "POV" (point-of-view) scenes or to play primarily in first person, Immersive First Person View is included. It's a little wonky, so it's disabled by default. Ensure you're in first person mode (F key by default, click the right stick for the controller) and press _NUMPAD 0_ to enable it. Then press F / R3 again and look downward. Should work tolerably well for POV scenes (maybe a bit of clipping) except for animations where the actors are _really_ close to each other. 

**You cannot switch to third person anymore without deactivating IFPV with _NUMPAD 0_!**

To _disable IFPV_ once you have enabled it, ensure that you **can** see your body when you look downward, then press _NUMPAD 0_. You will automatically switch to a third person view. Once more the _F_ or _R3_ buttons will return to its default function, as will the scroll wheel.

You can always watch a scene from an external view with SexLab's default freecam available with _NUMPAD 3_. Use the mouse to look around and WASD to move your "camera".

# A Bit of a Note about "Death Alternatives"

All of the _SexLab_ death alternatives are a mess. I have wrestled with them for years. They basically consist of dozens of conditionally called functions that consist of lengthy redundant nested Elseif loops. Translation: they're bloated, slow, and don't work. I am angry with them. I don't want to provide support for them. And I definitely don't want to get sidetracked into trying to fix them in the middle of a playthrough. So I disabled all of them for _Licentia_ and used the sane, SFW alternative _Ashes_ instead.

But I know they're popular. Erotic roleplay is a thing. So there are two of them in the _Servitium_ profile: _Combat Surrender_ which is part of _Cursed Loot_ and seems to equip you in punishing bondage gear no matter what options are set, and a combination of the relatively SFW _Death Alternative: Your Money or Your Life_ and the decidedly NSFW _SexLab Defeat_ which will hopefully work about 50% of the time.

Assuming you follow the MCMs as directed, you will fall to your knees upon death to be taken advantage of sexually. This will be very slow to start until Papyrus untangles all the spaghetti code. (You can smack it to hurry up by pausing or opening the console.) After your attackers are finished, the screen will fade to black and someone will either rescue you or rob you. C'est la vie. If you don't like what just happened reload, if you didn't have these crappy mods you would have died anyway.

You are free to change the death alternative options around as much as you like, but I will not answer questions or respond to recommendations about them anytime, anywhere.

# Arousal and Clockwork

Once you get the message about the collapsed passage north of Riften, I recommend you ignore it if you are playing with Cursed Loot. Traveling to this area locks you into a zone with no way to return for about 5 - 10 playtime hours and no targets for SexLab interactions or vendor services. This will make it extremely difficult to relieve yourself or remove yourself from devices. You can try disabling it but as stated above it rarely works.

# A word about ENBs

_Rudy_ finally did a _Cathedral Weathers_ preset so I have dropped everything to add it. 

If you don't like it for some weird reason I have tested these.

_Silent Horizons_ is probably the best one I've ever seen... before _Rudy_ that is.

_PI CHO_ is based off of SH but has more customization options that I've seen anywhere. Good luck preventing stonework from shining like headlights.

_Amon's ENB_ comes highly recommended from _Living Skyrim_ and other users. It's supposed to be pretty light so this should be your first choice if stuff gets stuttery.

_Rudy_ will technically work but is not recommended as it has no variant which supports Cathedral Weathers.

_Serio's ENB_ is probably the best ENB for customizing with the _Cathedral Weathers MCM_. It's also performance friendly for those without beast rigs. Be warned though, it's brighter than the rest.

_lJoss_ is Lexy's new standard but requires darker lod mods and custom DynDOLOD settings that I do not use. This ENB is not compatible.

The other ENB's seemed either so inferior or were completely incompatible that I didn't mention them. I also left out any ENB preset that hasn't updated in over six months, since SSS support and the wet shader effect was added to the binaries.

If you don't want to install this list because you don't want to fiddle with multiple ENB's, consider _ENB and ReShade Manager_. It makes swapping a one- or two-click affair.

## Requirements

- [Nexus Premium Account](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/store/category/1-premium-membership/)
- [LoversLab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)
- [MEGA Account](https://mega.nz/aff=a94uEwwXPLU) (OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

### System Specs

- CPU: >= 7th gen Intel processor OR >= AMD Ryzen 3000 series processor
- GPU: >= 1060, you need at least 6GB of VRAM
- RAM: >= DDR4 with at least 16GBs

Everything should be installed on an SSD that has at least 150GB of space available. **You won't be able to play the modlist with 4GB of VRAM**.

# Installation

##  Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to **Updating**  in the **Troubleshooting** section.

####  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from Microsoft. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Direct link</a> if you can't find it.

####  Steam Config

**Disable the Steam Overlay**

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB and is recommended to be turned off.

Open the Properties window (right click the game in your Library->Properties), navigate to the General tab and un-tick the Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game checkbox.

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically update the game for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), head over to the Properties window, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_ while you're at it.

**Set the Game language to English**

Wabbajack will check your game files and make sure that we have the same version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab and select English from the dropdown menu.

**Clean Skyrim**

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. **Do not install Skyrim anywhere inside any Program Files folder. Wabbajack will not work in a folder that is protected by Windows.** You should also clean up the Skyrim Special Edition folder in Documents/My Games/. If you have download throttles or caps, or just don't want to wait, you can also use [Skyrim Shredder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30133) by trawz to clean your installation.

**Start Skyrim**

After you have done everything above and have a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the Options menu.

    Click on Ultra
    Set the Aspect Ratio and Resolution to your monitor's native values
    Set Antialiasing to Off
    Uncheck Windowed Mode and Borderless

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

##  Using Wabbajack

###  Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD. You will also need an additional 30 GB beyond the modlists' official size to store temporary working files. It is not recommended to allow your drive to get over 90% full (red bar in File Explorer) so be sure to leave yourself a little headroom on top of all that.

    Adjust the Installation Location to a directory located on the root directory of one of your drives
    For example, this might be "C:\LeS", "D:\LeS", or "E:\LeS"
    Ensure the Download Location is within that directory
    Click the Go/Begin button
    Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

**DO NOT CONTACT MOD AUTHORS DIRECTLY.**

**Could not download x:**

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till the modlist receives an update.

**x is not a whitelisted download:**

This can happen when update the modlist receives an update. Check if a new update to the modlist is available and wait if there is none.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the Pre-Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator.

**MEGA files stuck at _100%_**

The files from MEGA are very large and must be verified. Please be extremely patient and allow each file to hash for at least 30 minutes, up to two hours if you are not using a solid-state drive. If you are certain you can't download the files any other way, try manual download from the Manifest in Wabbajack's lower-left corner.

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple Wabbajack lists. Sometimes it does anyway. Try signing up for a MEGA account, or if you have already done so, try logging out of it and downloading anonymously (although much more slowly).

**Wabbajack cannot continue because of unknown files.**

Move your downloads folder outside of your _LeS Directory_, ensure the _LeS Directory_ is clear of all files, then close and restart Wabbajack. Be sure to point the downloads box to your relocated downloads folder.

###  Post-Installation

**Copy Game Folder Files**

Download the latest ENB Series from [here](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm) and copy d3d11.dll and d3dcompiler_46e.dll to your game folder.

Copy all of the files from the _LeS Directory/game folder files_ directory to your game folder.

# Preparing the Game

The next step is to prepare the game for play. Navigate to the directory where you installed the modlist _Licentia et Servitium_. Inside you will notice an executable file called _ModOrganizer.exe_. This file (the _Mod Organizer 2_ application) has already been automatically installed and configured by Wabbajack with all the necessary mods to run the modlist and does not need to be updated, replaced, or manually configured. Simply launch it to continue.

# Choosing your Profile

The profile is set to "Servitium" by default. This is the extremely kinky build but is selected by default as a way to build all outfits available. If you wish to play with bondage and creature support, leave this dropdown alona and follow the steps at [Crafting the Female Bodies] below. 

The main profile is "Licentia et Servitium" and it is mainly based around consensual dialog sex. It is also intended, but not required, to be played in third person with a controller. If you wish to use the controller, you will have to delete "ControlMap_custom.txt" from your _Skyrim_ directory and download [Antimicro](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro/releases/download/2.23/antimicro-2.23-win32.msi). Set your left stick to _WASD._ Otherwise you can't move. If you don't like this disable my controller options. You can do this by unchecking everything under _Controllers_ in the left pane. This profile is the one I hope to make a playthrough on so it's set the way I like it.

"Servitium" is the alternative. This is intended for submissive females who are into bondage, vampires, werewolves, and incomplete buggy mods. The camera and controls are plain Skyrim and there's no _CGO_ because it fucks with shit. You can still use _TK Dodge_ which is a poor choice. I don't plan on troubleshooting this profile very much because it's obviously not ready for primetime. Feel free to submit an issue to Github and I'll try to look at it if I think there's a chance of fixing it (there probably isn't)

# Crafting the Female Bodies

I have not included pre-generated BodySlide files due to distribution issues. I have also not distributed custom patches as they would be huge. So, you will have to customize female bodies yourself.

**Warning: If you skip all this and launch the game, your women will look be tiny then fat, change shape in different armor, and have flat chests with melting physics. Please, follow the readme.**

[Female Bodies and Outfits](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/blob/master/BODYSLIDE.md)

# Launching the Game

The rest must be completed after the game itself is launched. Oh yes, there's more. I recommend bringing up this readme on a portable device by navigating to [www.wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org) and referring to the Gallery. Anyway, Launch the modlist from the command which reads **RUN ME TO START THE GAME**, create your character, and follow _all_ of the instructions in the below link:

[Licentia et Servitium Configuration](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/blob/master/MCMs.MD)

#  Adding Followers, Outfits, and Other Mods

This is not "officially" supported as per _Wabbajack Rule 11_. That said, I know you want to do it anyway, so I will offer this instruction.

**Screen Archery** by adding _Poser Mods_ is not supported. Download the _Cupid_ modlist for this purpose.

For _Gear_ it's as simple as adding it under _Added Mods_ and above _LEAVE HERE AT THE END_ in the left pane and the very bottom in the right pane. If your mod comes with _BodySlides_ (it should say so in the description) you will have to select them from the _Groups..._ menu and run them as per the instructions in the _Bodies_ section. If your gear mod does something crazy like add a huge museum of displays or put in chests for you to find you might have some issues. Otherwise, just use _AddItemMenu_ (in your inventory by default) to search for the item by name and put it in your inventory. _AddItem_ is the ultimate cheat so don't use it if you want to play the "game" part of the game. I leave it in because this list is mostly sexy people and I want players to look good exactly the way they want. If the temptation is too great just drop it before you talk to the Mara Statue.

For _Follower Mods_ add them and enable them under _Added Mods_ and above _LEAVE HERE AT THE END_ in the left pane and just above _DynDOLOD_ in the right pane. If they have a lot of custom actions you will have to craft an _NFF Ignore Token_ and equip it on them after you recruit them. Be sure _not_ to "Import" *any* followers into the _Framework_ or everything will break. Also, do not recruit *any* followers that do not have a default "Follow me" option (or something similar). If you are unsure about your follower, read its description page and all compatibility notes for any problems with "Nether Follower Framework." If any are mentioned, you will probably need an Ignore Token. If your follower mod contains any quests to go along with them they may conflict with stuff or even cause buggy dark faces on main characters. No way to know for sure without being a modder.

Finally, I **_MIGHT_** support the addition of a handful of _Lover's Lab_ mods depending on what they are and how much time I have to troubleshoot. _DO NOT ASK ANYONE ELSE BUT ME **(cacophony#0001)** TO TROUBLESHOOT LOVER'S LAB MODS THAT YOU ADD TO MY LIST._ 

I will say from the beginning that many of the more popular ones, such as mods that constantly scan for stuff like periods, pregnancies, breast milk, etc. often cause problems in the end if not configured extremely carefully and run on a minimal build. I lack the capacity and the patience, but I refer you to our Discord's [#nsfw-mod-discussion] channel to request a link to _ForgottenGlory's_ modlist _"Dungeons & Deviousness"_. It has all kinds of nifty stuff that is the hallmark of _Lover's Lab,_ like _SexLab Survival_, _Sanguine's Debauchery_, _Estrus Chaurus_, and much more. _ForgottenGlory_ has been around the block himself, he created _"Living Skyrim"_, by far _Wabbajack_'s largest and most popular list. By all means, please play that list if you want such mods.

All that said, if you can't figure out a mod on your own that I did not mention above, I may help you work it in on a case-by-case basis depending on how busy I am. It is expected that you have familiarity with Mod Organizer 2, xEdit, FNIS, Nemesis, and basic knowledge of what an override patch is before you try to do anything beyond basic outfit or follower additions. If you don't know this stuff don't ask or come prepared for some homework.

Finally _do not ask about non-Lover's lab mods_ except really simple things like makeup, hair, outfits, or voice tracks. I do not have the time to write custom patches for these. And just to make it clear, _DO NOT ASK ANYONE ELSE BUT ME **(cacophony#0001)** TO TROUBLESHOOT YOUR ADDITIONS._ Rule 11 fully applies to everyone else but me. If you don't remember it, go to [#welcome] and read all the rules again for real this time.

# Specific Mod Details

To be added. For now look them up on the Nexus or Lover's Lab. Should be able to right click on them and select "Visit Nexus" or "Visit Lover's Lab"

# Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _LeS_ folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.

I am regularly available on the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) (`#nsfw-mod-discussion`) (`#licentia-et-servitium-support`). I will not respond to personal messages unless I know you. **DO NOT MESSAGE ME**
