# Licentia et Servitium: A Modest Sampling of Lover's Lab

## BEFORE YOU CONTINUE: 

**THE VERSION YOU ARE ABOUT TO DOWNLOAD OR JUST DOWNLOADED IS OUT OF DATE**

The **Github** version is the most up to date, but it is still experimental. If you are interested, get the **3.2.1 Pre-release** one from the **Releases Section ->** (You have to click the small releases link)

If you prefer not to deal with my update madness, the last relatively finalized version is **2.0.1.2** also from **Releases ->**

My README from then is long gone, but you can view the _MCM_ section [here](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/blob/19a278c85872f68f3bd5375c347e8b7e63101924/MCMs.MD)

Also, **minor fixes** have been posted in the support channel. Check the pins once you get in there (small thumbtack icon)

## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

I'm [cacophony](https://github.com/cacophony-wj), a humble person. I haven't been modding long, but I want to provide a modlist until a bigger NSFW one is made.

I also want to make a list with a lot of options.

Finally I want a list for the casual gamer who maybe wants to indulge in a little heroic fantasy.

That said, I have been putting _NSFW_ content into games since the first _Nude Raider_ patch so I am familiar with it. 

While not as customized as TSO, as feature-rich as Living Skyrim, or as depraved as Lotus, if you want a basic Skyrim gameplay and sexual overhaul that offers many ways to have fun, you are welcome. And of course, there's CGO, LOTD, and Maids.

## A STRONG WARNING

## SexLab SE is still **beta!** It is still buggy!

Before posting a question to Discord, look at [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Many common questions are answered there.

# Number One Rule: This List Is Customizable

Your kinks are a very private thing. I have included a modest sampling of the most popular _Lover's Lab_ mods. They are almost all geared toward female submissive characters with particular fetishes. There really is no way to disable most of them in-game, so below you will find options for completely disabling the mods that offend you. Don't worry! You won't hurt anything. There are no merges and every patch is geared to one purpose. The advantage is that stuff can be easily removed, the disadvantage is there's less room for 12 huge DLC sized mods and fifteen weapons compilations.

# Misaligned Animations

I have included a ton of animations, almost the maximum, so people don't feel the need to pack in more. Many of them are less than perfect. If they are not aligned you will have to do it yourself. Here's how it works... the _L_ key on your keyboard moves you _forward,_ i.e. closer to your partner. _Shift-L_ moves you _backward,_ or the reverse. _semicolon ;_ moves you _up_, or higher in elevation than your partner. _Shift-;_ does the reverse. Finally, _apostrophe '_ moves you _Right_ compared to your partner, whereas _Shift-'_ moves you _Left_.

#  Admiring Yourself

For those who want to experience "POV" (point-of-view) scenes or to play primarily in first person, Immersive First Person View is included. It's a little wonky, so it's disabled by default. Ensure you're in first person mode (F key by default) and press _NUMPAD 0_ to enable it. Then press the F key again and look downward. Should work tolerably well for POV scenes (maybe a bit of clipping) except for animations where the actors are _really_ close to each other. 

**You cannot switch to third person anymore without deactivating IFPV with _NUMPAD 0_!**

To _disable IFPV_ once you have enabled it, ensure that you **can** see your body when you look downward, then press _NUMPAD 0_. You will automatically switch to a third person view. Once more the _F_ key will return to its default function, as will the scroll wheel.

You can always watch a scene from an external view with SexLab's default freecam available with _NUMPAD 3_. Use the mouse to look around and WASD to move your "camera".

# A Bit of a Note about "Death Alternatives"

All of the _SexLab_ death alternatives are a mess. I have wrestled with them for years. They basically consist of dozens of conditionally called functions that consist of lengthy redundant nested Elseif loops. Translation: they're bloated, slow, and don't work.

But I know they're popular. Erotic roleplay is a thing. So there are two of them in this list: _Combat Surrender_ which is part of _Cursed Loot_ and seems to equip you in punishing bondage gear no matter what options are set, and _SexLab Defeat_ that randomly locks up your game because somebody died while in the middle of raping you. Have fun.

I have left enabled the only option that works consistently: _Defeat's_ manual surrender. If you want to see yourself get raped, approach a hostile and surrender immediately to them with the _K_ key. If you try to surrender in a fight you will probably die before Defeat kicks in, again because of the bloat. If you want to roleplay a surrender do it early when you know you're outnumbered.

Nothing additional (theft, knockout, imprisonment) will happen to you except an exhaustion debuff for about five minutes. My latest testing shows the Trauma animation is screwed with Nemesis so you better run fas' and slam back some Power Ale.

I can't make anything else work consistently and not suck. Raping people yourself is also disabled because that sometimes screws up too. If you must see these animations, set up an aggressive scene with SexLab Tools as per the description of that mod.

You are free to change the death alternative options around as much as you like, but I will not answer questions or respond to recommendations about them anytime, anywhere.

# Arousal and Clockwork

Once you get the message about the collapsed passage north of Riften, I recommend you ignore it if you are playing with Cursed Loot. Traveling to this area locks you into a zone with no way to return for about 5 - 10 playtime hours and no targets for SexLab interactions or vendor services. This will make it extremely difficult to relieve yourself or remove yourself from devices. You can try disabling it but as stated above it rarely works.

# A word about ENBs

I have chosen _Re-Engaged_ as the ENB because best I can tell _Silent Horizons_ needs an update. I have tweaked it a bit to make rain more apparent and to brighten interior lighting a touch.

If you don't like it I have tested these:

_Silent Horizons_ was causing flicker for me. I think it needs an update, but you could always try it. I prefer it far more then _Re-Engaged._

_Hardlandson's_ is a great third choice with fantastic interiors and atmospheric fogs. Personally I think the exteriors are a little too washed out.

_PI-CHO_ looks great for character close-ups and resembles Silent Horizons for everything else, but the specular map for wet effects is a bit too bright for me.

_Rudy_ will technically work but is not recommended as it has no variant which supports Cathedral Weathers.

_Serio's ENB_ is probably the best ENB for customizing with the _Cathedral Weathers MCM_. It's also performance friendly for those without beast rigs. Be warned though, it's brighter than the rest.

_lJoss_ is Lexy's new standard but requires darker lod mods and custom DynDOLOD settings that I do not use. This ENB is not compatible.

The other ENB's seemed either so inferior or were completely incompatible that I didn't mention them. I also left out any ENB preset that hasn't updated in over six months, since SSS support and the wet shader effect was added to the binaries.

If you don't want to install this list because you don't want to fiddle with multiple ENB's, consider _ENB and ReShade Manager_. It makes swapping a one- or two-click affair.

## Requirements

- [Nexus Premium Account](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/store/category/1-premium-membership/)
- [LoversLab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)
- [MEGA Account](https://mega.nz/aff=a94uEwwXPLU) (OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
- A brain, eyes and time to read through this README

### System Specs

- CPU: >= 7th gen Intel processor OR >= AMD Ryzen 3000 series processor
- GPU: >= 1060, you need at least 6GB of VRAM
- RAM: >= DDR4 with at least 16GBs

Everything should be installed on an SSD that has at least 256GB of space available. **You won't be able to play the modlist with 4GB of VRAM**.

# Installation

##  Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to **Updating**  in the **Troubleshooting** section.

####  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from Microsoft. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Direct link</a> if you can't find it.

####  Steam Config

**Disable the Steam Overlay**

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB and is recommended to be turned off.

Open the Properties window (right click the game in your Library->Properties), navigate to the General tab and un-tick the Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game checkbox.

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically update the game for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), head over to the Properties window, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_ while you're at it.

**Set the Game language to English**

Wabbajack will check your game files and make sure that we have the same version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab and select English from the dropdown menu.

**Clean Skyrim**

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. **Do not install Skyrim anywhere inside any Program Files folder. Wabbajack will not work in a folder that is protected by Windows.** You should also clean up the Skyrim Special Edition folder in Documents/My Games/. If you have download throttles or caps, or just don't want to wait, you can also use [Skyrim Shredder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30133) by trawz to clean your installation.

**Start Skyrim**

After you have done everything above and have a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the Options menu.

    Click on Ultra
    Set the Aspect Ratio and Resolution to your monitor's native values
    Set Antialiasing to Off
    Uncheck Windowed Mode and Borderless

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

##  Using Wabbajack

###  Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD. You will also need an additional 30 GB beyond the modlists' official size to store temporary working files. It is not recommended to allow your drive to get over 90% full (red bar in File Explorer) so be sure to leave yourself a little headroom on top of all that.

    Adjust the Installation Location to a directory located on the root directory of one of your drives
    For example, this might be "C:\LeS", "D:\LeS", or "E:\LeS"
    Ensure the Download Location is within that directory
    Click the Go/Begin button
    Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

**DO NOT CONTACT MOD AUTHORS DIRECTLY.**

**Could not download x:**

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till the modlist receives an update.

**x is not a whitelisted download:**

This can happen when update the modlist receives an update. Check if a new update to the modlist is available and wait if there is none.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the Pre-Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator.

**MEGA files stuck at _100%_**

The files from MEGA are very large and must be verified. Please be extremely patient and allow each file to hash for at least 30 minutes, up to two hours if you are not using a solid-state drive. If you are certain you can't download the files any other way, try manual download from the Manifest in Wabbajack's lower-left corner.

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple Wabbajack lists. Sometimes it does anyway. Try signing up for a MEGA account, or if you have already done so, try logging out of it and downloading anonymously (although much more slowly).

**Wabbajack cannot continue because of unknown files.**

Move your downloads folder outside of your _LeS Directory_, ensure the _LeS Directory_ is clear of all files, then close and restart Wabbajack. Be sure to point the downloads box to your relocated downloads folder.

###  Post-Installation

**Copy Game Folder Files**

Download the latest ENB Series from [here](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm) and copy d3d11.dll and d3dcompiler_46e.dll to your game folder.

Copy all of the files from the _LeS Directory/game folder files_ directory to your game folder.

# Preparing the Game

The next step is to prepare the game for play. Navigate to the directory where you installed the modlist _Licentia et Servitium_. Inside you will notice an executable file called _ModOrganizer.exe_. This file (the _Mod Organizer 2_ application) has already been automatically installed and configured by Wabbajack with all the necessary mods to run the modlist and does not need to be updated, replaced, or manually configured. Simply launch it to continue.

# Crafting the Female Bodies

I have not included pre-generated BodySlide files due to distribution issues. I have also not distributed custom patches as they would be huge. So, you will have to customize female bodies yourself.

**Warning: If you skip all this and launch the game, your women will look be tiny then fat, change shape in different armor, and have flat chests with no physics. Please, follow the readme.**

[Female Bodies and Outfits](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/blob/master/BODYSLIDE.md)

**Sun Jul 26 05:46:08 2020**

# Launching the Game

The rest must be completed after the game itself is launched. Oh yes, there's more. I recommend bringing up this readme on a portable device by navigating to [www.wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org) and referring to the Gallery. Anyway, Launch the modlist from the command which reads **RUN ME TO START THE GAME**, create your character, and follow _all_ of the instructions in the below link:

[Licentia et Servitium Configuration](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/blob/master/MCMs.MD)

# Hey, what happened to the two profiles? And why can't I disable stuff anymore?

Two profiles means I have to double animation folders or you get T-Pose when you switch. Disabling stuff gives nonfunctional animations because every mod you would want to disable has animations with it. So d'oh. If you want less kink, you're going to have to disable what you can from the _MCM_ and deal with it until _Dungeons & Deviousness_ comes out of Alpha.

#  Adding Followers, Outfits, and Other Mods

This is not "officially" supported as per _Wabbajack Rule 11_. That said, I know you want to do it anyway, so I will offer this instruction.

**Screen Archery** by adding _Poser Mods_ is not supported. Download the _Cupid_ modlist for this purpose.

For _Gear_ it's as simple as adding it under _Added Mods_ and above _LEAVE HERE AT THE END_ in the left pane and the very bottom in the right pane. If your mod comes with _BodySlides_ (it should say so in the description) you will have to select them from the _Groups..._ menu and run them as per the instructions in the _Bodies_ section. If your gear mod does something crazy like add a huge museum of displays or put in chests for you to find you might have some issues. Otherwise, just use _AddItemMenu_ (in your inventory by default) to search for the item by name and put it in your inventory. _AddItem_ is the ultimate cheat so don't use it if you want to play the "game" part of the game. I leave it in because this list is mostly sexy people and I want players to look good exactly the way they want. If the temptation is too great just drop it before you talk to the Mara Statue.

For _Follower Mods_ add them and enable them under _Added Mods_ and above _LEAVE HERE AT THE END_ in the left pane and just above _DynDOLOD_ in the right pane. If they have a lot of custom actions you will have to craft an _NFF Ignore Token_ and equip it on them after you recruit them. Be sure _not_ to "Import" *any* followers into the _Framework_ or everything will break. Also, do not recruit *any* followers that do not have a default "Follow me" option (or something similar). If you are unsure about your follower, read its description page and all compatibility notes for any problems with "Nether Follower Framework." If any are mentioned, you will probably need an Ignore Token. If your follower mod contains any quests to go along with them they may conflict with stuff or even cause buggy dark faces on main characters. No way to know for sure without being a modder.

Finally, I **_MIGHT_** support the addition of a handful of _Lover's Lab_ mods depending on what they are and how much time I have to troubleshoot. _DO NOT ASK ANYONE ELSE BUT ME **(cacophony#0001)** TO TROUBLESHOOT LOVER'S LAB MODS THAT YOU ADD TO MY LIST._ 

I will say from the beginning that many of the more popular ones, such as mods that constantly scan for stuff like periods, pregnancies, breast milk, etc. often cause problems in the end if not configured extremely carefully and run on a minimal build. I lack the capacity and the patience, but I refer you to our Discord's [#nsfw-mod-discussion] channel to request a link to _ForgottenGlory's_ modlist _"Dungeons & Deviousness"_. It has all kinds of nifty stuff that is the hallmark of _Lover's Lab,_ like _SexLab Survival_, _Sanguine's Debauchery_, _Estrus Chaurus_, and much more. _ForgottenGlory_ has been around the block himself, he created _"Living Skyrim"_, by far _Wabbajack_'s largest and most popular list. By all means, please play that list if you want such mods.

All that said, if you can't figure out a mod on your own that I did not mention above, I may help you work it in on a case-by-case basis depending on how busy I am. It is expected that you have familiarity with Mod Organizer 2, xEdit, FNIS, Nemesis, and basic knowledge of what an override patch is before you try to do anything beyond basic outfit or follower additions. If you don't know this stuff don't ask or come prepared for some homework.

Finally _do not ask about non-Lover's lab mods_ except really simple things like makeup, hair, outfits, or voice tracks. I do not have the time to write custom patches for these. And just to make it clear, _DO NOT ASK ANYONE ELSE BUT ME **(cacophony#0001)** TO TROUBLESHOOT YOUR ADDITIONS._ Rule 11 fully applies to everyone else but me. If you don't remember it, go to [#welcome] and read all the rules again for real this time.

# Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _LeS_ folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.

# Contact

I am regularly available on the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) (`#nsfw-mod-discussion`) (`#licentia-et-servitium-support). I will not respond to personal messages unless I know you. **DO NOT MESSAGE ME**
