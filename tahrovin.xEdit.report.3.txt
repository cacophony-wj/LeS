[06] Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp (0CD1CA0B) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 000371D6 <Maul>

May want to forward the AI package here.

[11] LegacyoftheDragonborn.esm (AB30CB57) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 00009C81 <FalkreathExterior05> \ 000F23C1

This door triangle might be important.

[12] 3DNPC.esp (C60DC7D3) \ Cell \ 00013907 <KynesgroveBraidwoodInn> \ 000E55B7
[12] 3DNPC.esp (C60DC7D3) \ Cell \ 00013907 <KynesgroveBraidwoodInn> \ 000E566D
And more...

You need to make absolutely certain that all of the Persistent references from 3DNPC are forwarded. I have it on good authority that they are important for the quests included.

[1E] Realm of Lorkhan - Custom Alternate Start - Choose your own adventure.esp (F1D5C860) \ Dialog Topic \ 00017222 <MQ102AHadvarIntroA1> \ 00017228

You deleted the other one like this, but I guess this is just personal preference...

[4B] Riverwood by Mystirious Dawn.esp (02069B4F) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 000096F2 \ 0000A6F2
And more...

In my own experience, overhauls to towns, homes, buildings and other similar areas have Landscapes that should always
take priority over Landscape Fixes. It may not be an issue, but I recommend checking around Riverwood for clipping
objects or gaps in the terrain. If they are there, you will get complaints.

[4E] Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods.esp (4F589808) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 00007640 \ 00008640
[4E] Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods.esp (4F589808) \ Worldspace \ 0000003C <Tamriel> \ 00009428 <DeadMensRespiteExterior02> \ 0000A428

Similar situation here. This is a chonkin' ESP but I only found these two besides the Riverwood ones.

[50] Friendlier Taverns.esp (C8E7F78D) \ Cell \ 00013814 <WinterholdTheFrozenHearth> \ 000DDA06
[50] Friendlier Taverns.esp (C8E7F78D) \ Cell \ 00013907 <KynesgroveBraidwoodInn> \ 000E55B7
[50] Friendlier Taverns.esp (C8E7F78D) \ Cell \ 00013907 <KynesgroveBraidwoodInn> \ 000E566D
[50] Friendlier Taverns.esp (C8E7F78D) \ Cell \ 00013A7F <DawnstarWindpeakInn> \ 000E0600

Probably want these to be Persistent as well.

[61] AI Overhaul.esp (6B112801) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 00013261 <Beirand>
[61] AI Overhaul.esp (6B112801) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 00013281 <GiraudGemane>
And more...

It seems as though some of these AI packages, particularly with regard to Pandorables, need to be forwarded.

[73] Immersive Sounds - Compendium.esp (5426346A) \ Magic Effect \ 0001CEA2 <FrostDamageFFAimed>
And more...

It looks like a lot of the magic sounds from ISC have been overwritten by Mysticism. Ensure this is correct.

[7E] Skyrim Revamped - Complete Enemy Overhaul.esp (5E048CD3) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 0001B07C <MercerFrey>
And more...

If you want the enhanced combat abilities from SRCEO to apply to badass, unique NPCs such as this one, you need
to forward the Perks, Items, Keywords, Skill Values, and any and all Actor and Magic Effects from those ESPs,
whether the SRCEO base ESP or the Releveled Patch. All other data needs to come from your appearance overhauls,
such as Pandorables Males in this case, with possible VMAD (scripts) from USSEP. You may not wish to do this. 
Just be certain.

[81] Populated Dungns Caves Ruins Legendary.esp (D5C43FBD) \ Cell

Pretty sure Lux needs to win these Cell lighting values.

[8A] ClickySoundBegone.esp (37418630) \ Sound Descriptor \ 0006BE1F <UIMagicSelect>

You probably want to leave this sound blanked. It gets rid of an annoying repetetitive click when using 
Spellsiphon's features.

[8E] MysticismMagic.esp (77D16829) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 000204C0 <MAG_SummonAtronachFlame>

You should use the stat and other skill and combat values from Mysticism for this section, except perhaps the Female value
from MNC where included.

[90] Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes.esp (9D71ACC7)

Triumvirate includes a chicken in Riverwood which, if killed, yields every spellbook from this mod. You may wish to disable
and bury it.

[BD] PAN_NPCs_Males2 - AI Overhaul SSE patch.esp (20597BB1) \ Non-Player Character (Actor) \ 0001A6D5 <Athis>

If you are going to overwrite a later NPC appearance record with an earlier one, you need to ensure the facegen from the
later mod (PAN MALES) has been hidden. They are the NIF and DDS values with the same FormID.
