# Licentia Configuration

## Setting your resolution

_minilicentia_ has been configured to run at _2560x1440_ by default. If you wish to change this to a higher or lower resolution, click the hammer and gear icon and choose _INI Editor_. Now search the _SkyrimPrefs.ini_ for a line that begins with _iSize_. (Should be under [Display] which is itself in alphabetical order.) Change the values for _iSize H_ and _iSize W_ to the resolution you wish. Below are some common resolutions you can use.

"1080p" is _iSize H = 1080_ & _iSize W = 1920_
"1440p" is _iSize H = 1440_ & _iSize W = 2560_
"2160p" or "True 4K" is _iSize H = 2160_ & _iSize W = 3840_

If you have an Ultrawide monitor, you will need [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1778). Install it as you would any other Mod Organizer. Just put it under _Added Mods._ Then adjust the above values to your monitor's native resolution.

I can't help you get it working or test problems with it because I don't have Ultrawide. You can always refer to other Wabbajack readmes or drop by Discord and type _!usesearch_ to hunt for other users' experiences.

## Customizing Controls

The vast majority of these options are configured in the "Controls" portion of Skyrim's pause menu. Please take note that your "Sneak" key is **NO LONGER SNEAK**, it is **DODGE** instead. If you wish to select a sneak key, first configure your **DODGE** key (which is labeled as **SNEAK** in the "Controls" menu, remember). Then open the MCM and choose the _Ultimate Dodge_ option. There is an entry there for "Sneak Key", click it and choose. In the end I think you will be better served with Dodge as _Shift_ and Sneak as _CTRL_.

To change the _Quick Light_ key, open the _Quick Light_ MCM and you should see the option. The same is true for _CGO_, there are options for _Grip Shift_ and _Dual Wield Blocking_.

## Enabling Enhanced Gamepad Controls

Due to a request from multiple users I have returned the enhanced Gamepad control mods. They are all enabled by default, but serve no purpose so long as you use a mouse and keyboard. However, if you wish to play with a controller, you will have to **delete any ControlMap_Custom" file(s) in your Skyrim game directory. You will have to configure CGO (I recommend D-Pad Left for grip shift and LB for Dual-Wield Blocking), The Ultimate Dodge Mod (I recommend D-Pad Down for Sneak), and Quick Light (I recommend D-Pad Up).  Finally, reconfigure your QuickSave and QuickLoad keys in-game. You must ALSO recall that almost ALL OStim navigation can only be accomplished via the keyboard, so you will have to either switch back and forth or set to autopilot. When all is said and done the Gamepad controls will be as follows:

- Start: Journal
- Back: Wait
- LT: Left Attack
- RT: Right attack
- LB+Back: Quicksave
- RB+Start: Tween menu (character menu)
- LB+RB: Shout (in that order, you kinda haveta roll your fingers across them)
- LB: Lock-on (toggle)
- RB: Sprint, Dual-Wield Block
- LS: Favorites
- RS: Switch POV
- A: Activate
- B: Roll
- X: Ready weapon
- Y: Jump
- D-Pad Up: Turn on / off Quick Light
- D-Pad Down: Sneak / Stop Sneaking
- D-Pad Left: Switch grip between 1-handed and 2-handed (CGO)
- (Yes, you will crouch up and down and turn lights on and off in dialog menus.)
- (Use the sticks instead!)

## Character Creation

Creating a face is very time consuming so I have included many presets. Use your mouse to click the _Presets_ button in the upper right, choose _Load Preset_, and experiment with the options. Make sure your race matches the race of the preset (A - Altmer, Bo - Bosmer, Br - Breton, D - Dunmer, I - Imperial, N - Nord, O - Orsimer, R - Redguard). I have also recently included a host of presets from one of my users, featuring male and female variants for every race, including Argonians and Khajiit.

Tweak to your liking, but bear in mind that many of the close-cropped hairstyles will **NOT** look right until you select the _High Poly Head_ by navigating to the _Head_ portion of RaceMenu and choose _Face Part 3_ (near the bottom). You might enjoy some of the _KS SMP_ hairs in the rightward section of the _Hairs_ slider, they have physics which probably won't work until character creation is complete. You can also tweak your body a bit with the _CBBE Morphs_ and _Genitals_ options, but I am not going to go into that. Most of the options will not function correctly until you have completed character creation at least once -- when you have done so, remove your clothing (if so desired), turn around and use the "Vanity Mirror" to make final adjustments. (Don't go too crazy with the dong, or it will poke through people's heads!) This option is basically the same thing as Riften's "Face Sculptor" and causes none of the bugs and dropped racial and magic effects that the _showracemenu_ command does. Experiment and figure it out. 

**IF YOUR BODY OR FACE TURN PURPLE OR OTHERWISE WEIRD**, scroll Racemenu over to _Body Paint_ and make sure all Textures are set to _Default_ (press the "T" key)

## AS SOON AS CHARACTER CREATION IS COMPLETE

**DO NOTHING** until **ALL** of the messages in the top left corner stop appearing. This is the most script intensive part of the game and may break otherwise. (It almost certainly will break if you forgot to copy game folder files.)

## A bit of a note on System Settings

## Controls

**Under the System > Settings Menu** change _Quicksave_ to _F9_, and _Quickload_ to _F10_. Don't worry about using them because _Engine Fixes_ converts them to full saves. 

## DEFAULT CONTROLS AND HOW TO CHANGE THEM

The vast majority of these options are configured in the "Controls" portion of Skyrim's pause menu. Please take note that your "Sneak" key is **NO LONGER SNEAK**, it is **DODGE** instead. If you wish to select a sneak key, first configure your **DODGE** key (which is labeled as **SNEAK** in the "Controls" menu, remember, and is assigned to **CTRL** by default). Then open the MCM and choose the _Ultimate Dodge_ option. There is an entry there for "Sneak Key", click it and choose. In the end I think you will be better served with Dodge as _Shift_ and Sneak as _CTRL_.

To change the _Quick Light_ key, open the _Quick Light_ MCM and you should see the option. The same is true for _CGO_, there are options for _Grip Shift_ and _Dual Wield Blocking_.

## Game MCM Options

**NOTE:** Any menus or options not specifically mentioned here can be ignored. I have used what limited xEdit and Papyrus knowledge I possess to configure them automatically at game init (while those messages were cycling earlier)

## A Matter of Time

Load the User Preset.

##  CGO

### Settings

#### Leaning

**I recommend the following values:**

_Lean Multiplier (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

_Lean Multiplier (3rd Person)_: _X0.25_

_Camera Noise_

_Camera Noise Mult (1st Person)_: _X0.00_

## Extended Encounters

For stability, I recommend leaving these options alone. However, for more radiant variety and difficulty, you can experiment with the following options:

### World Encounters

Enable "Draugr Swarm" and "Factions Hunt Player" under _Toggle Specific Encounters._ The Swarm is as you expect, but Factions Hunt Player means that if you join the Stormcloaks, Imperial hit squads will hunt you, as well as similar results for other opposing factions. It can be tough!

### Location Encounters

These are probably a terrible idea, but all the options under _Toggle Location Raid Encounters_ can be enabled to permit bandit raids on towns, law enforcement raids on criminal dens, and Civil War raids by each opposing faction respectively. Enable cautiously!

##  Follower Framework

###  System

In the upper right, click _Load From File - CLICK HERE_

At the message **Settings Loaded. Please exist the MCM menu to apply all changes.** click _Ok_

Exit the MCM and re-open it.

## Fertility_Mode

_Be Warned:_ This mod is _very_ intrusive, with a lot of "heavy" features, and currently suffers from a few bugs in the implementation of the code necessary to disable it as well as manage magic effects and onscreen widgets properly. If this concerns you, or you do not wish to deal with the difficulty inherent from possessing a full fertility and reproductive cycle, **do not** enable this mod, as in its current state it **can not** be fully disabled again. If this is not a concern of yours...

"Enable" the mod. This is a _slow_ process. Give it about 30 seconds to check itself.

Check _Unique Women Only_ and _Unique Men Only_.

The only other options you may be interested in are under "Automation" in the lower right.

The _Spouse Fidelity_ option is hilarious if you set it down to around 50%. This basically means you have more baby mama drama than an Oklahoma trailer park.

_Randomly Inseminate_ allows you to simulate widespread fucking without acting it out. Be wary of this mode!

Finally, under _Information_, the _Show Verbose Messages_ option with pop up various methods on Skyrim's sexual exploits such as, with spouse fidelity low: "Embry came inside Gerdur."

## Genesis Spawns

### TO BE EXPANDED WITH FURTHER DETAIL

The meat of _minilicentia's_ difficulty. Spawns extra enemies in each area. I tested with everything maxed, incuding OBIS, and it was _tough_ at early level. Probably something like 4 additional spawns for each mod is more appropriate.

## OBIS - Bandits

First Enable the mod, then decide how many extra bandits you want at every bandit spawn. The default is a pretty good number, but the difficulty is low, so feel free to set it as you wish. The more spawns you add, the more trouble your system will have, so try to use a guesstimate of what your system can handle. As a frame of reference, I had all 3 Dynamic Spawn mods maximized and occasionally experienced hard freezes for up to a minute with a Radeon 5 3600 and an NVIDIA 2070 SUPER. No crashes as of yet.

## OStim

The settings in this extensive mod are almost all down to personal preference. I recommend you carefully read the mod pages for both "OSex" and "OStim" if you wish to configure sex into an interactive little "minigame". 

However, I do have the following recommendations:

### Configuration

#### Sex Scenes

Uncheck "Actors Control Speed."

Set the "Excitement Multiplier" to 3.00.

#### Beds

Uncheck "Use Beds". Nice idea but too buggy.

#### Undressing

Uncheck everything but "Fully undress at start."

### How To Use This Mod

OSex is a little tough to get used to but the gist is that you use 8,4,5, and 6 on the NUMPAD like another set of WASD keys to move around in the OSex menus. 7 chooses a command, 9 swaps actors or functions, 1 cancels a command. + is inspect / advance scene, enter is open or close menu. Period or decimal ends the scene. 

If you are unfortunate and have a 75% keyboard or some other device without a NUMPAD, you will have to use an autohotkey script or remap the OSex controls somehow. Join my private server and search the #licentia channel for tips. You can find the link in the #sse-licentia channel on the Wabbajack Discord.

Bear in mind that many subjects do not have appropriate animations (such as lesbian scenes). To find these, press the backslash key \ at any time, type in a keyword, and press Enter to begin.

At any time you can go up to anyone and press the up arrow to have OSex sex with them.

Creatures do not function with OSex and I have no plans to ever implement them. Play DND.

### OStrap

I am not a fan of strap-ons, but I am even less of a fan of futa options, so this mod is included for reasons. I recommend the following options:

_OStrap Core_

"Enable mod" and "Enable for NPC." Use "Enable for Player" only if you are female.

_OStrap Integrations_

"Enable OCum Support"

_Enabled Strapons_

All.

## Quick Light

This is automatically set to NUMPAD 1. Set it to whatever you wish. All it does is turn on a light so you can see around you.

###  SexLab Solutions

####  follower

Choose the appropriate options here to offer a follower instead of yourself for sexual favors. This is mainly useful if you aren't attracted to a particular sex.

## SKY UI

### General

Set _Font Size_ and _Icon Size_ to your preference, likewise with _Category Icon Theme_. (I personally only really like the "Celtic" version of the icons.)

### Advanced

Due to the location of additional HUD elements like the minimap, under "Active Effects HUD" you will need to set _Vertical Anchor_ to "Center".

## SmoothCam

### Presets

Click on _Slot 2: EasyEase_ under _Load Preset_ on the **RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN** and wait for the message.

## Spellsiphon

### TO BE ADDED SHORTLY

## Trade and Barter

Click "Modify Barter Settings" and change the "Preset" to your liking, but I recommend "Easy" because you will probably really be chewing through the potions.

## VioLens

### Profile System

Click _Load_ and select _VioLens._ Wait about three seconds until the menus stop cycling.

## All done!

Be sure to make a last second save in case something bad happens. You _do not_ want to do these MCMs again. I have expanded roleplaying options from the beginning of the game with the mod "Abandoned Prison Tweaks." First turn around and grab the key and mirror on the shelf nearby. The mirror is what you should use to change your appearance -- it causes far fewer bugs than the ``showracemenu`` command. The book provides a little flavor text on how you got where you are. The key opens the cabinet nearby, which you should do now. Inside you will find a chest with scrolls to assign your starting spells -- take all of them if you are a power gamer, or only the ones that represent your background. All starting spells have been removed. On the middle shelf is another key, which you should grab, and a cask with a few potions in it. On the bottom shelf is a chest with various crappy starting gear you can choose. Return your attention to the top shelf again. Somewhere floating around all glitchy is the "Firmament" book which, when read, will allow you to choose any Standing Stone buff in the game. (I really need to fix the placement of this.) There are two ways to choose where you will spawn. The statue, as in most lists, provides a host of specfic roleplaying options. The books on the upper left of the cabinet will allow you to choose a sexy start where you are stripped of all your clothes -- great for roleplaying with your chosen gear. After choosing one, check the small chest hidden behind a barrel in the corner where you started for a dozen lockpicks if you wish to take them. Then sleep on the bed to begin. Unfortunately, INI tweaks necessary for clippingless first person mode to function properly render the vanilla start unplayable. I recommend you choose "camping in the woods" if you want to begin near Helgen. It is highly unlikely that I will disable the tweaks necessary for clippingless first person.

# ULTRA MEGA IMPORTANT

**The Ultimate Dodge** will **NOT** work until you leave the starting cell after sleeping on the bed after talking to the statue or choosing a book. It will also **NOT** work **UNTIL YOU PRESS G TWICE.** The **FIRST** thing you should do as soon as you spawn is **PRESS G TWICE**. If you message me about how you are stuck in the air after a dodge, I will tell you to read this entire readme again.
