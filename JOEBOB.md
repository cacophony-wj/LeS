A friend of mine spent months digging through webforums and the Nexus when he started modding, compiling a massive, 300-strong list of all the mods he wanted to try. He did this back before Special Edition came out, then sat on it for years. He made a few stabs at putting a list together himself, and although he had made his own kickass player home entirely from scratch in The Pale (which is dutifully included in this list), he lacked the patience for the spreadsheet-like work of xEdit. Not to mention he has a life, and no time for patching hundreds of mods! So this is where trusty, indolent, slightly-mad cacophony comes in. We... came to an agreement.

There is no real central theme or idea to this list. It doesn't have LOTD, it has the "Interdimensional Chambers" for storing all your gear in a compact, circular room where everything is arranged with maximum efficiency and practicality (think Ironforge). It has vanilla weathers. It has vanilla lighting. (Well, except for Quick Light.) It uses a vanilla-inspired ENB. It also has a bunch of badass dog companions, assloads of new crossbows laying around all over the place, a few bits and pieces of Enairim, plenty of Oblivion-derived gear and monster mods, and some really silly power fantasy adds like CGO and Ion Cannon. Oh and your spells look like they are out of Doctor Strange. 

It's also made for SUPER low end PC's... there are no texture overhauls. There are no parallax textures. There's no 4K anything -- the most comprehensive texture mod is UPOT 1024. DynDOLOD is here, but for the most part, the system requirements are not much higher than they are for vanilla Skyrim SE. The only bad part is it kinda looks like vanilla Skyrim -- ass. But hey! Solid 60 FPS everywhere! This suited my friend as well as he is also due for a PC upgrade.

This is _Joe Bob_, a modlist for Joes and Bobs everywhere.

## Running Wabbajack

If you found this readme you are probably familiar with the process. I don't know, I don't feel like repeating myself, go check one of the other modlists' instructions on how to install with _Wabbajack._ I will say the ENB requires the 0.347 binary, so be sure to get that instead of the most recent.

## MCM

The MCMs are pretty simple and self-explanatory, except for CGO, which you can check my _Licentia_ readme for tips on using, and a few that bear mentioning.

### The Most Massive Favorites Menu You Will Ever See

My friend plays with a controller. This list is for a controller. So the favorites menu takes up the whole _screen_ and has everything broken down by item type and spell school. If you don't use a controller you probably won't like this.

### Assigned Storage

Every time you access a crafting table, this mod pools all your crafting materials into a huge global cloud storage system which you draw from to craft with. It takes a bit to load and unload, so don't do anything until the messages stop in the upper left corner. There's also a way to "tag" any container in the game as a recipient for this "cloud storage" so never worry about buying a home again if you don't want. Make your own Whiterun cheat barrel, only like a box in Resident Evil that magically stores infinite things in all the other barrels you've marked this way! If you don't like the way the mod works you're gonna hafta tweak it with the MCM and the spells it grants you, not everything is in a menu.

### Ion Cannon

This explodes and dismembers and disembowels and chunks everything over several acres and has no casting cost and practically no cooldown. Forgive my friend... he's special.

### Those Dozens of Summoned Monster Mods, Though! A mountable **T-REX**? An **OGRE FOLLOWER?** WHAT THE _F***_?

Special.

### Is this modlist a shitty, half-baked mess?

Yes. But it's still fun! And if you have a total butt laptop yourself or something this is probably the biggest Skyrim modlist that will run on it.
