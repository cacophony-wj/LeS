A friend of mine spent months digging through webforums and the Nexus when he started modding, compiling a massive, 300-strong list of all the mods he wanted to try. He did this back before Special Edition came out, then sat on it for years. He made a few stabs at putting a list together himself, and although he had made his own kickass player home entirely from scratch in The Pale (which is dutifully included in this list), he lacked the patience for the spreadsheet-like work of xEdit. Not to mention he has a life, and no time for patching hundreds of mods! So this is where trusty, indolent, slightly-mad cacophony comes in. We... came to an agreement.

There is no real central theme or idea to this list. It doesn't have LOTD, it has the "Interdimensional Chambers" for storing all your gear in a compact, circular room where everything is arranged with maximum efficiency and practicality (think Ironforge). It has vanilla weathers. It has vanilla lighting. (Well, except for Quick Light.) It uses a vanilla-inspired ENB. It also has a bunch of badass dog companions, assloads of new crossbows laying around all over the place, a few bits and pieces of Enairim, plenty of Oblivion-derived gear and monster mods, and some really silly power fantasy adds like CGO. Oh and your spells look like they are out of Doctor Strange. 

This is _Joe Bob_, a modlist for Joes and Bobs everywhere.

## Running Wabbajack

If you found this readme you are probably familiar with the process. I don't know, I don't feel like repeating myself, go check one of the other modlists' instructions on how to install with _Wabbajack._ I will say the ENB requires the 0.347 binary, so be sure to get that instead of the most recent.

## MCM

The MCMs are pretty simple and self-explanatory, except for CGO, which you can check my _Licentia_ readme for tips on using, and a few that bear mentioning.

### The Most Massive Favorites Menu You Will Ever See

The favorites menu takes up the whole _screen_ and has everything broken down by item type and spell school. You probably won't like this. But Bob does. And so do most Joes. So live with it.

### Assigned Storage

Every time you access a crafting table, this mod pools all your crafting materials into a huge global cloud storage system which you draw from to craft with. It takes a bit to load and unload, so don't do anything until the messages stop in the upper left corner. There's also a way to "tag" any container in the game as a recipient for this "cloud storage" so never worry about buying a home again if you don't want. Make your own Whiterun cheat barrel, only like a box in Resident Evil that magically stores infinite things in all the other barrels you've marked this way! If you don't like the way the mod works you're gonna hafta tweak it with the MCM and the spells it grants you, not everything is in a menu.

### The Chambers

Like collecting stuff like in LOTD, but don't wanna, you know, make a whole _thing_ out of it? The Interdimensional Chambers are hands down the most efficient player home I've ever seen. Bob spent dozens of hours in the PS3 version of Hearthfires planning out the most optimal home before he discovered PC Gaming and especially the CK. Now you can benefit! Every item type in the game has a box designed for that type conveniently placed next to all the furniture and/or crafting stations related to that item type. There's a gold dispenser. And if you use Nether to tell all your followers to live here, everything is markered and navmeshed -- even the pantry and beer kegs.
